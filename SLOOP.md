# SLOOP 2.5

**A live groovebox firmware for the M-VAVE FM-1 — for any style.** Four tracks — three synths and a drum machine with 16 sounds on the white keys — twelve synthesis engines (six-operator FM with DX7 patches, and now physical models and noise), 153 sounds, 37 drum kits (808, 909, trap, phonk, house, techno, UK garage, jungle, amapiano, reggaeton, synthwave, chiptune, ambient, jazz…), your own samples, ghost notes and ratchets, parameter locks, micro timing and fills, note repeat, one-key chords, 16 punch-in effects, a vinyl / sidechain / DJ-filter master, and a teenage-engineering-style screen that always shows what your hands can do next. Sixteen built-in drum groove starters provide editable starting patterns; you can still play and record every part yourself.

SLOOP is free and open source (GPL-3.0), based on [Felucca](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca) by Leo Kuroshita / Hügelton Instruments.

> **Status:** 2.5, running on the FM-1. Still a beta: install at your own risk, and please report what you find (GitHub issues).

> **Looking for one control?** [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md) is the complete guide: every button, key combination, layer, page and editor page, with a [one-page cheat sheet](GUIDE.md#26-cheat-sheet).

### New in 2.5

- **PHYS: physical models.** An eleventh engine, from Felucca 1.0 (the models of DaisySP and Mutable Instruments Rings, by Emilie Gillet): plucked and struck strings, bars and bells, drum heads, and strings with sympathetic strings that ring along. Guitars (NYLON GTR, STEEL GTR, MUTED GTR), PLUCK BASS, KOTO, BANJO, SITAR and TANPURA, PHYS HARP, CHIMES, BIG BELL, VIBRA BAR, STEEL PAN, WOOD BLOCK, CELLO BOW, GLASS BOWL, TABLA, CONGA, TIMPANI and more: 26 sounds.
- **NOISE.** A twelfth engine, from Felucca 1.0: noise from analogue to digital, through a resonant filter. WIND, RAIN, OCEAN, VINYL, HISS, RISER, NZ SNARE, BITCRUSH, RADIO, NZ ARCADE, NZ METAL.
- **153 factory sounds** (76 in 2.4): 77 new, every one level-matched. Besides PHYS and NOISE: bass guitar, mono and saw basses, harp, steel drum, glockenspiel, celesta, xylophone, tubular bell, pan flute, harmonica, accordion, a 70s string machine (ENSEMBLE), an 80s poly synth, rock and chapel organs, granular clouds (STR CLOUD, SHIMMER, DRONE, PNO FREEZE, HORN CLOUD), chip sounds (NES BASS, CHIP CHORD, WAVE LEAD…), CZ lead / pad / reso, ROBOT and VOX PAD. See [The sound bank](#the-sound-bank).
- **Two engines, no memory more.** GRAIN, FM6 and PHYS keep their big per-track state in one shared area (a track plays one engine at a time), so the new engines cost no memory at all; the pitch table now takes 768 bytes instead of 8 KB. Every sound of 2.4 renders bit for bit as before.
- **The web editor: piano roll, MIDI files, song.** On the **Sequencer** page: a **length** control (1–64 steps; the steps redraw at once), a **piano roll** to draw, delete and stretch notes and chords with the mouse, and **Export MIDI / Import MIDI** for the selected track (the drum track too, as GM drum notes), with a preview that says what moves or does not fit before anything is written. A new **Song** page edits the order of the sections A–D, as the FM-1's SONG screen does. Thanks to the viewer who suggested them!
- **USB audio at 48 kHz too: record into your phone.** The FM-1's USB audio input now also runs at 48 kHz when the phone, tablet or app asks for it (many only take 48 kHz), resampled in the FM-1 (after Felucca 1.1.5). Plug it into your phone and record into a sampler app. At 44.1 kHz nothing changed.
- **Drum synth: make your own drum kits.** A new page in the web editor changes every value of the synthesised drum sounds — the tone and its pitch drop, the click, the noise (white, the 808's metal, chip, clap), the filter, drive and level — and the FM-1 plays each change at once. Four kits of your own, **SYN1–SYN4**, after the others on the drum track's KIT, stored on the FM-1, in backups and as files.
- **DX7 cartridges in one go.** Drop a .syx file on the editor's FM6 panel, tick up to 27 of its voices (the first 27 are ticked) and **Store cartridge in bank** puts them in B1, B2… in one write, asking before it replaces anything. Choose to add them to the user presets too, and the FM-1's PRESETS and SELECT find them by name; or pick them with PTCH. Thanks to the viewer who asked!
- **A delay send for the drums.** GLO → DRUMS → **DLY** (next to REV) sends the drum track into the tempo delay: echoing hats, dub snares. CC 94 on the drum channel sets it too. Thanks to the viewer who asked!
- **MIDI CCs (after Felucca 1.1.5).** A controller's knobs now set the sound: CC 7 level, 10 pan, 74 the track's filter, 71 resonance, 73 / 75 / 72 attack / decay / release, 5 glide, 91 / 93 / 94 the reverb, chorus and delay sends, on the track the channel plays (as the notes). Until now SLOOP ignored every CC.
- **Swing reads 0 to 100.** 0 is straight, 100 the strongest (a step pair played 75 / 25, MPC's 75 %); it used to read 50–75 %. The swing itself and your projects did not change.
- **SEL, as printed on the button.** The key / scale button between FX and ENV is now called SEL everywhere (its pages SEL and SEL 2, the calibration, the guides); it was written SCL. Not to be mixed up with the SELECT knob.
- **The DRUMS page's level dial** goes from ghost on the left to hard on the right (its needle followed the wrong order; the levels were right).
- **Fixed** (2.4.1, folded into 2.5): imported DX7 patches with **AMS** above 0 (about one in four) played noise and static: they now sound as on a DX7. The **click** (and the REC count-in) is heard again with your own drum kits and with the drum track muted or another track soloed: it has its own sound now. In chord mode, a key on the **STEP** page writes the whole chord it plays, not only its root.

Projects, autosaves and backups from 2.4 load as they are. Going back to 2.4: a track playing PHYS or NOISE opens with another engine there, and 2.4 does not keep the SYN kits (a drum track on SYN1–4 plays USR3+4 there), so keep a backup.

### New in 2.4

- **FM6: six-operator FM, DX7 patches.** A tenth engine: the classic six-operator FM synthesis of Dexed (msfa), as Felucca 1.0 ported it — 32 algorithms, a full patch per track. Eight factory patches (TINE EP, GLASS BELL, ROUND BASS, BRASS SECT, SOFT PAD, WOOD BARS, DRAWBARS, NYLON PICK) in the sound bank, a bank of 27 of your own on the FM-1, and in the web editor a patch editor that **imports DX7 SysEx** (one voice or a 32-voice bank) and exports it. DIGITAL (the 4-operator FM) stays as it was. See [FM6](#fm6-six-operator-fm-and-dx7-patches).
- **Parameter locks.** A step held: **PRESETS** gives one sound parameter another value for that step only, **ALGORITHM** picks which one (the last one you turned). 24 locks per track, several on one step. See [SEQ — steps](#seq--steps-step-sequencer).
- **Micro timing.** A step held: **KNOB 4 NUDGE** moves it off the grid, half a step early to half a step late, in 1/64 of a step.
- **Fills.** A step held: **OCT+** makes it *fill only* or *no fill*. Hold **GLO** + key **9** for a fill while you hold it, or key **10** for a fill on the whole next bar.
- **Quick chain.** Hold **SAVE** and tap several sections (A B B C…): let go and they play in turn, each for its pattern's length, round and round. See [Song mode](#song-mode).
- **Clock only.** GLO → SYSTEM → **IN** = **CLOCK**: SLOOP follows the MIDI clock and ignores incoming notes (asked for by the community).
- **The sequencer to MIDI OUT.** GLO → SYSTEM → **MIDI** = **SEQ**: what the sequencer, the arp and the rolls play goes out on USB MIDI too (each track on its channel, the drums on 10) — drive another synth or record the notes in a DAW. **KEYS** (as before): only what you play on the keys.
- **Longer steps, dotted delays.** DIV goes to **1/2**, **1BAR** and **2BAR** (a 64-step track can last 128 bars: drones, chord changes, slow songs). The delay's TIME has **1/8D** and **1/16D**, the dotted delays.
- **A filter on each track.** One knob, **FILT**: turn left for a low-pass, right for a high-pass, centre for off — on each synth track and on the drums. It is on the new **FILTER** page (FX, then SELECT or FX again), and live under **FX held + KNOB 4** for the selected track. It can be locked on a step, it stays when you change the sound, and it is saved with the project (asked for by the community).
- **CHORD+ (after HiChord and minichord).** In chord mode the black keys change the chord you play: major ↔ minor, 7th, sus4, 9th, inversion, even while it is held. **STRUM** plays a chord's notes one after the other, **VLEAD** voices each chord nearest the last. See [SEL — key and chords](#scl--key-and-chords).
- **Your own drum kits, and a 4th sample slot.** A new slot, **USR4**, in flash nothing used before. The drum track's KIT goes on to **USR1–USR4** and **USR3+4**: a big kit of about 15 s over two slots, so USR1 and USR2 stay free for instruments. Build it in the editor's new **Drum kit** page (drop WAVs on 16 pads, pitch, gain and length each, choose where it goes) and send it. See [Your own drum kits](#your-own-drum-kits-kit-usr1usr4-usr34).
- **A new web editor.** Rebuilt to look and feel like the FM-1: its black screen, the four track colours, its own pixel font; the pages of each button as rows of four coloured knobs, values you drag like a knob, the steps as the device's tiles. See [The web editor](#the-web-editor).
- **The visualiser.** On the TRACKS screen, tap **HOME**: twenty-one full-screen visualisers of what plays (oscilloscope, spectrum, spectrogram, Lissajous, VU meters, circle, tape, LCD, bounce, orbit, wires and the SLOOP logo itself), **SELECT** to change. See [The visualiser](#the-visualiser).
- **The menu in sections.** HOME held: SCREEN, LIGHTS, AUDIO, SYSTEM; **SELECT** turns the sections as it turns the pages, and KNOB 1, 2, 3 set the rows of the section directly, values in large type.
- **Bigger values.** The pages without a graph (EDIT, VOICE, ENV DEST, LFO DEST, GLOBAL, MASTER, SYSTEM, FILTER…) use the empty middle of the screen: their four values in large type, placed as the knobs are (1 2 / 3 4), the one you turn in white (asked for by the community).
- **SELECT turns the pages.** On a page (ENV, LFO, FX, EDIT, ARP, SEQ, SEL, GLO, SAVE), **SELECT** goes to the previous / next page of that group: no need to press LFO again to reach LFO DEST. On HOME, and while a layer is held, SELECT is still the tempo (asked for by the community).
- **Drums with the keys, heard as you pick.** On the drum **grid** page the white keys are the 16 steps of the sound KNOB 1 picks: press to set a step (you hear it), again to clear it; the first four black keys pick the page of steps. Picking a drum sound with KNOB 1 (grid page, or the SEQ layer on the drum track) plays it, and moving to a step with KNOB 2 on the grid plays what it holds (asked for by the community).
- **Lights.** HOME → **KEYS** has **ALL KEYS**: every key glows. With **NOTES** on, the short notes of the sequencer now light their keys too (each note stays lit about a tenth of a second, as the drum hits do: before, a 1/16 note could end between two screen frames and never show).
- **Fixes.** A MIDI START from a DAW during the REC count-in now starts and records at once (it left SLOOP armed and silent). Swing no longer shuffles the triplet divisions (8T, 16T), where it played a different note late on every beat. Turning DIV or the arp's RATE in the first beat after PLAY no longer skips a step. In the SEQ layer, KNOB 2 (DIV) now reaches 1/2, 1BAR and 2BAR too. The editor no longer writes presets or a preset bank to flash while the song plays (a ~50 ms drop-out): it asks you to stop first, as the FM-1 does. Values of 10 kHz and up show their unit (*12 kHz*, not *12.0 kH*). After Felucca 1.0.2 – 1.0.3.1: a knob turned as you let go of a layer (FX, EDIT, SEL, GLO…), or while you press PLAY in one, no longer edits the page under it; the processor's divide-by-zero trap is off (a compiler quirk could crash the FM-1 into UBOOT on a divide its code guards against); the serial console is off unless you turn it on (HOME menu → **USB SERIAL**), so macOS 13–15 see the USB audio input; the editor's **Import SysEx** reads damaged files (cut short, several banks, a wrong checksum) and says why when a file has no DX7 voice.
- Projects are now saved in format **FUN5** (the locks, nudges and fill conditions); projects, autosaves and backups from 2.3 load as they are. A backup from 2.4 also holds the FM6 bank. Going back to 2.3: it cannot read FUN5 projects (they look empty, and its autosave can write over the music in progress), and a 2.4 backup restores into 2.4 only — save a backup first.

### New in 2.3

- **A MIDI keyboard on the MIDI IN jack.** The FM-1's 3.5 mm TRS MIDI input works: channels 1–3 play the synth tracks, 10 the drums, 4–16 the selected track. The input reads its buffer by content, so no note is left hanging (fix from Felucca [Salt], by ChanceTheMaker and keremimo). See [MIDI keyboards](#midi-keyboards).
- **MIDI clock in.** GLO → SYSTEM → **SYNC**: USB or TRS, a setting of the FM-1 that stays when you load a project. SLOOP follows the master's tempo, START, CONTINUE and STOP, pulse by pulse, so it never drifts (after Felucca 1.0, from contributions by ChanceTheMaker and keremimo). See [MIDI keyboards](#midi-keyboards).
- **USB audio: record the FM-1 on a computer.** On USB the FM-1 is also an audio input (*Felucca*, 44.1 kHz stereo, no driver): record its master output in your DAW or Audacity, MIDI and the editor still working on the same cable (after Felucca 1.0). HOME menu → **USB AUDIO**: the level follows the MASTER knob, or **FULL**, a fixed full level. See [USB audio](#usb-audio-record-on-a-computer).
- **Choose how REC records.** On the REC screen: KNOB 1 **mode** — *free* (the free take: the tempo follows you) or *tempo* (record at the tempo you set) — KNOB 2 the **length** (1, 2 or 4 bars), KNOB 3 the **start** — your first note, or a one-bar **count-in** after PLAY. See [Recording](#recording).
- **Lights for playing in the dark.** Hold HOME → **LIGHTS**: every button glows (LOW, MID, HIGH), so the labels are readable on a black FM-1; the active ones stay at full light. **KEYS**: the C keys, or every white key, glow too. **NOTES**: the notes playing light their keys, on every page and in every layer (by @renebohne). The glow is a short pulse on every scan, as in Felucca 1.0.1: no flicker, and the dim marks read as dim. See [Lights](#lights).
- **Backup and restore.** The editor saves everything on the FM-1 in one file — the music you are working on, the projects, the user presets, the samples, the settings — and puts it all back. See [The web editor](#the-web-editor).
- **CHOP: recordings of any length.** A recording longer than a slot (about 7 s) is no longer a dead end: tick the chops you keep, untick the rest, shorten any chop (its length slider, or drag the handle at the bottom of the wave), or press **Fit to slot** to shorten the longest ones just enough. Only the kept chops go to the slot or the WAVs, on consecutive keys. See [The web editor](#the-web-editor).
- **Back to the official firmware from the installer page**, a backup first: select M-VAVE's FM-1 V15 file and install it (as in Felucca 1.0).
- **Steadier.** The knobs answer every click: no more dead moments, double clicks or jumps. A note-off sent from a computer is never dropped any more when a lot of MIDI arrives at once (a hanging note), and a malformed MIDI message is ignored. When the processor is overloaded, SLOOP fades out one voice at a time, after two late halves in a row and never the bass or the lead, instead of cutting the oldest note. Keys play about a millisecond sooner. A key let go just after a change of VOICE (POLY, MONO…) no longer leaves its note stuck. The settings, projects and presets are checked more strictly when they are read back from flash. (All after Felucca 1.0.)
- The installer page shows the right numbers (68 sounds, 37 kits).

### New in 2.2

- **A new drum engine.** Every synthesised drum is now built like on the classic machines: a tuned body with a pitch drop and a hold, a second partial for the drum heads, a click for the attack, noise through a resonant filter, drive. Softer hits are darker as well as quieter. The 32 synthesised kits are rebuilt on it, each with 16 sounds of its own — new: **PHONK** (melodic cowbell), **AMAPIANO** (log drum), **GARAGE**, **D.HOUSE**. Kits 1–5 are now a sampled **ACOUSTIC** kit (CC0 studio recordings) and its treatments. Every kit is level-matched. See [Drum kits](#drum-kits).
- **68 sounds, browsed by kind.** PRESETS goes through basses, keys, organs, pads, leads, plucks and bells, stabs; the kind is shown next to the name. 14 new: 808 SLIDE, ACID 303, PLUGG BASS, SUPERSAW, M1 PIANO, AFRO KEYS, GRAND PNO, KALIMBA, PLUGG BELL, GLASS PAD, SAW PAD, RAVE STAB, DUB CHORD, HOUSE ORGN. Every factory sound is level-matched: the same LEVEL gives the same loudness. See [The sound bank](#the-sound-bank).
- **A real grand piano.** GRAND PNO is a Steinway recorded note by note (CC0); long notes fade as on the real one. DUSTY PNO and LOFI KEYS are the same piano through an old sampler.
- **Lock a layer.** Hold a layer button and tap HOME: the layer stays open with the button let go, both hands free (FX with one hand on the keys and the other on FILTER / DUST / DUCK). Any other button lets it go. See [The panel](#the-panel-tap-hold-layers).
- **Stereo effects.** The chorus is stereo, and the reverb is new: a feedback delay network, dense and wide, with no metallic ring.
- **More reliable.** Saves that fail are retried (*SAVE ERROR: RETRYING*) and everything is saved before an update; the end of a song gives your loop back; swing never plays a step twice; SONG REC counts bars right; a voice retriggered in UNISON, TRIO or PHASE no longer clicks; NEW PROJECT and saving a user preset wait until the song stops; the installer refuses a damaged package before writing it; the button lights no longer flicker.

### New in 2.1

- **Songs, live:** hold SAVE — keys 1–4 play sections A–D on the next bar, keys 5–8 save the loop into them, key 14 records the song as you play it (each section and its bars). See [Song mode](#song-mode).
- **Landmarks on the keys:** while a layer is held, and on the drum track, keys 1, 5, 9 and 13 glow dimly — the first key of each row of the 4 × 4 grid on the screen. What is on (an effect, a step, a sound) stays fully lit.

### New in 2.0

- **Hold a button, touch a key.** Every function button is a *layer*: hold it and the 16 white keys and the four knobs change job, the screen shows how. Tap it and its pages open as before.
- **16 drum sounds on the white keys**, black keys double them. **OCT− / OCT+ held** = ghost / hard hits. Hits keep their level and a **ratchet** (x1–x4) in the pattern.
- **Note repeat** (ARP + key), **erase as it plays** (EDIT + key), **steps under your fingers** (SEQ + key, Elektron style), **one-key chords in the song's key** (SEL), **mute / solo / tap tempo** (GLO).
- **Undo / redo** (EDIT + OCT− / OCT+), **hold REC to clear**, and an **autosave** that brings your beat back at power-on.
- **MPC swing** (50–75 %), a sample-accurate clock (no drift, any tempo), tighter glides for the 808s.
- **Master:** **DUST** (an old sampler and a record: bits, rate, crackle), **DUCK** (the kick pumps the synths), **FILT** (DJ filter: low-pass ← OFF → high-pass).
- **Web editor:** the drum track as a 16-lane grid with levels and ratchets, the kit, the master page.
- **Safer updates:** the installer checks the package's SHA-256 and only resumes SLOOP's own update loader; the loader checks the package CRC before it starts the new firmware, and refuses a flash chip it does not know.

## Install

1. Double-click **`INSTALL-SLOOP.bat`** in the SLOOP folder. It builds the firmware and opens the installer at `http://localhost:8766/webapp/installer/`.
2. In **Chrome or Edge**, connect the FM-1 to the computer by USB (a data cable, directly — no hub).
3. Press **INSTALL**, allow MIDI access, and wait for *Done*. Keep the black window open until then.

The FM-1 restarts on the SLOOP logo. The editor is at `http://localhost:8766/webapp/editor/` (or **`OPEN-EDITOR.bat`**).

## Sixty seconds to a beat

1. **ALGORITHM** to track **4** (orange, drums). The white keys play 16 sounds: **F3 kick**, G3 kick 2, A3 snare, B3 clap, **C4 hat**, D4 open hat… **PRESETS** picks a kit: try *808* or *BOOMBAP*.
2. Press **REC**: *rec ready*. **Play a beat freely, at your own tempo** — no click, no count-in. Hold **OCT−** while you hit for ghost notes, **OCT+** for hard ones.
3. **Press REC on the "1" after your last bar.** The loop closes: its length sets the tempo, the hits snap to the grid, the loop plays at once.
4. **REC** again while it plays: you record on top (overdub). Hold **ARP** and hold the hat key: a 1/16 hat roll, recorded as ratchets.
5. Turn **ALGORITHM** to track **1** (blue, *808 BOOM*), **REC**, play a bass line. Hold **SEL** and press the key of your song (e.g. D); on track 2 hold SEL and turn **KNOB 1** to *7TH*: every white key is now a chord of the key.
6. Hold **FX** and press a white key for a punch-in effect; still holding FX, turn **KNOB 2** for DUST, **KNOB 3** for DUCK.
7. Made a mistake? Hold **EDIT** and press **OCT−**: undo.

## The colour code

| Colour | Track | Knob |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **blue** | 1 · synth | KNOB 1 |
| **green** | 2 · synth | KNOB 2 |
| **yellow** | 3 · synth | KNOB 3 |
| **orange** | 4 · drums | KNOB 4 |

The four dials at the bottom of the screen show what KNOB 1–4 do now. White always means *what you are touching*. Red always means *recording*.

## The panel: tap, hold, layers

Every function button has two lives. **Tap** it (press and let go, touching nothing else): its pages open, as on any FM-1 firmware. **Hold** it: a **layer** — the 16 white keys and KNOB 1–4 change job while it is held, and after 0.14 s the screen shows the 16 keys as tiles and the knobs as dials. Let go: back to playing.

The tiles are four rows of four, keys 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, 13–16. To find them without looking at the screen, the first key of each row (1, 5, 9, 13) glows dimly while a layer is held, and on the drum track; the keys at full light are what is on.

**Lock a layer:** hold its button and tap **HOME** — the layer stays open when you let the button go, both hands free for the keys and the knobs (*LOCK* on the screen, the button blinks). Any other button lets it go (HOME, the layer's own button, ENV…) and does only that; PLAY, REC and OCT− / OCT+ keep working inside it.

| Hold | Keys | KNOB 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 | Tap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FX** — *punch* | a punch-in effect while the key is held | FILTER · DUST · DUCK · TRK FILT (the selected track's filter) | FX pages |
| **EDIT** — *erase* | erase that sound / note from the pattern | SHIFT · LENGTH ×2 / ½ · TRANSPOSE · — | EDIT pages (drums: grid / kit) |
| **ARP** — *roll* | note repeat on the grid | RATE · — · — · — | ARP pages |
| **SEQ** — *steps* | steps 1–16 of the page — a step held: OCT+ its fill condition (normal · fill only · no fill), OCT− clears its nudge, locks and condition | SOUND / NOTE · DIV · SWING · LENGTH — a step held: SOUND / NOTE · LEVEL · RATCHET · NUDGE (PRESETS: the lock, ALGORITHM: its parameter) | SEQ pages (drums: grid / kit) |
| **SEL** — *key* (between FX and ENV; not the SELECT knob) | the key of the song | CHORD · SCALE · KEYS · TRANSPOSE | SEL pages |
| **GLO** — *mix* | 1–4 mute · 5–8 solo · 9 **fill** while held · 10 **fill bar** (the next bar) · 16 tap tempo | level of tracks 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 | GLO pages |
| **SAVE** — *song* | 1–4 play section A–D (next bar; two or more tapped while SAVE stays held: a **chain** of them, looped) · 5–8 save the loop into A–D · 13 loop / song · 14 SONG REC · 16 the song screen | — | TRACKS: the SONG screen · else the SAVE pages |

Other controls:

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **PLAY** | start / stop all four tracks (works inside any layer) |
| **REC** | playing: record now / stop · stopped: arm (the first note starts) · free take: close the loop |
| hold **REC** | clear the selected track (a ring fills: keep holding ~2 s; let go before and nothing happens) |
| **SAVE** | on TRACKS: the SONG screen · elsewhere: the SAVE pages |
| **EDIT + OCT− / OCT+** | undo / redo |
| **ALGORITHM** | select the track (on every page) |
| **PRESETS** | the selected track's sound, or the drum kit |
| **SELECT** | on HOME (and inside a layer): the tempo · on a page: the previous / next page of its group (it stops at the ends) · on the DRUMS screen: grid / kit |
| **OCT− / OCT+** | synth tracks: octave (both: back to 0) · drum track, held: ghost / hard hits |
| **HOME** | the TRACKS screen · on the TRACKS screen: the [visualiser](#the-visualiser) (HOME again closes it) · hold: the menu (SCREEN, LIGHTS, AUDIO, SYSTEM) · tapped while a layer is held: lock it open |
| **ENV / LFO** | their pages |

## The drum track

Track 4 plays **16 sounds, one per white key** from the lowest F to the highest G; a black key plays the sound of the white key on its left (two fingers on one sound, for fast rolls).

| Key | Sound | Key | Sound | Key | Sound | Key | Sound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F3 | kick | C4 | hat | G4 | snare 2 | D5 | ride |
| G3 | kick 2 | D4 | open hat | A4 | low tom | E5 | shaker |
| A3 | snare | E4 | pedal hat | B4 | hi tom | F5 | conga |
| B3 | clap | F4 | rim | C5 | crash | G5 | cowbell |

**Levels:** every hit has one of four levels — **GHOST**, **SOFT**, **NORM** (as played), **HARD**. Hold **OCT−** while you hit for ghost notes, **OCT+** for hard hits; they are recorded so. **Ratchets:** a hit can repeat x1–x4 inside its step (ARP rolls record them; SEQ + a step + KNOB 3 sets them). The closed and pedal hats choke the open one.

## Recording

SLOOP records live and layers every pass on top of the last (overdub). Notes go to the nearest step **as you heard it**: the time between a key and its sound (~12 ms) is taken back, so what you play on the beat lands on the beat. Chords are kept on the synth tracks (up to 4 notes a step); held notes become ties.

| When | REC does | Then |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Playing** | records the selected track **at once** | REC again stops recording, the loop plays on |
| **Stopped, project with notes** | arms (*rec ready*, the REC light blinks) | **your first note starts the loop and is step 1**; PLAY starts it too |
| **Stopped, empty project** | arms (*rec ready* · *play freely*) | a **free take** (see below), or MODE *tempo*: as with notes |

**The REC screen sets how it records** (armed, before the first note), with the knobs:

| Knob | Dial | Choices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KNOB 1 | **mode** (empty project only) | **free**: a free take, the tempo follows you · **tempo**: record at the tempo set (SELECT) |
| KNOB 2 | **length** | the loop of the selected track: **1, 2 or 4 bars** |
| KNOB 3 | **start** | **note**: your first note starts the loop · **count**: press **PLAY**, one bar of clicks (4, 3, 2, 1 on the screen), then the loop starts recording; notes played before only sound |

MODE and START are settings of the FM-1: they stay as you left them. In a project with notes there is no MODE: it always records at the tempo set (a free take would change the tempo of what is already there). During the count-in, REC cancels it and PLAY goes back to *rec ready*.

**Free take — the loop follows you.** On an empty project there is no tempo yet, so you set it by playing:

1. REC, then play freely. The screen shows *free take*, the seconds, and the loop it would make right now (*2 bars · 92 bpm*).
2. **Press REC on the "1" after your last bar.** The time from your first note to that press is the loop: SLOOP picks 1, 2 or 4 bars at the tempo nearest the one set (within 3 % the set tempo is kept), writes your notes into it with their lengths and levels, and plays it at once. All four tracks take that length.
3. **PLAY** during a free take drops it. A take closes by itself after 24 s.

- While recording the REC light is solid and the track shows a red *rec*. Turn ALGORITHM and the take moves to the next track without stopping.
- The **PLAY light flashes on every beat**: a visual metronome. An audible click: GLO → GLOBAL → **CLICK** (`OFF`, `REC`, `ON`); it is never recorded.
- **Swing** goes from 0 (straight) to 100 (the strongest, MPC swing at 75 %) (GLO → GLOBAL → SWING for all tracks, SEQ + KNOB 3 per track). The swing of a track adds to the global one.

## Layers in detail

### FX — punch

The 16 white keys are the [punch-in effects](#punch-in-effects); they run while the key is held. The knobs drive the [master](#master-dust-duck-filt): **KNOB 1 FILTER** (turn left: low-pass, right: high-pass, centre: off), **KNOB 2 DUST**, **KNOB 3 DUCK**; **KNOB 4 TRK FILT** is the same filter on the selected track only (its FILT, on the FX → FILTER page). Keys pressed while FX is held never play or record notes.

### EDIT — erase

Hold EDIT and press a key: that sound (drums) or that note (synths; with CHORD on, the notes of its chord) leaves the selected track's pattern — **while playing**, from every step the playhead passes while you hold the key (MPC style: hold the hat key for one bar and the hats of that bar are gone); **stopped**, from the whole pattern at once. *ERASED* flashes. The knobs reshape the whole pattern:

- **KNOB 1 SHIFT** — every step one later / earlier (turns the groove around).
- **KNOB 2 LENGTH** — right: ×2 (the pattern copied after itself, up to 64 steps); left: ½.
- **KNOB 3 TRANSPOSE** — every note a semitone up / down (synth tracks).
- **OCT− undo · OCT+ redo** (the knob turns of one hold count as one change).

### ARP — roll (note repeat)

Hold ARP and hold a key: it repeats on the grid at the **RATE** of KNOB 1 — 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 32T, 1/64 — locked to the tempo and the swing, so it always lands in time. On the drum track OCT− / OCT+ make it ghost / hard. While recording, a roll is written as ratchets (a 1/32 roll on a 1/16 track: x2 on each step). Rolls end with their key.

### SEQ — steps (step sequencer)

The 16 white keys are the 16 steps of the page; the lit ones play. The first four black keys (F#3, G#3, A#3, C#4) or **OCT− / OCT+** pick page 1–4 (steps 1–16, 17–32, 33–48, 49–64, up to the track's LENGTH).

- **An empty step:** press its key — it is set at once. Drums: with the sound shown (KNOB 1 picks it, or the last pad you hit); synths: with the note or chord you played last.
- **A set step:** press and let go — it is cleared (with its nudge, locks and fill condition). Hold it and turn a knob instead — it is edited, and kept: **KNOB 1** sound (drums) / note (synths), **KNOB 2 LEVEL** (ghost, soft, norm, hard), **KNOB 3 RATCHET** (x1–x4), **KNOB 4 NUDGE**; **PRESETS** a parameter lock, **ALGORITHM** which parameter; **OCT+** its fill condition. Hold several step keys to edit them together. **OCT−** with a step held clears its nudge, locks and condition.
- **No step held:** KNOB 1 the sound / note to set · KNOB 2 **DIV** (1/4 … 1/32, triplets, 1/2, a bar, two bars) · KNOB 3 **SWING** of the track · KNOB 4 **LENGTH** (1–64 steps; each track loops on its own length, polymeters stay in phase).

**Nudge (micro timing).** A step held + KNOB 4 moves it off the grid: −32 … +31 in 1/64 of a step, minus = early (the step plays before its grid time, inside the previous step), plus = late. The ratchets of the step move with it; the recording and the swing stay on the grid. On the drum track the whole step moves, every sound. A nudged step shows a dot in the corner of its tile.

**Parameter locks.** A step held + **PRESETS** gives one sound parameter another value *for that step only* — the **lock parameter** starts as the last sound knob you turned on a page (ENV, LFO, FX, EDIT, VOICE…; *FLT* of ENV DEST until you turn one) and **ALGORITHM** steps through the others (wrapping round); the title line shows it: *lock dst 14*, *lock flt --* (no lock yet). The first click of PRESETS makes the lock at the track's current value, the next ones move it; at the next step without a lock on it the parameter comes back to what it was (notes still ringing follow, Elektron style). A knob turned on the page while a lock is in force wins: that value is kept as the new base. Several locks can sit on one step (one per parameter), 24 per track; the pattern, arp, key and voice-mode parameters cannot lock. A locked step shows the same dot as a nudged one; OCT− with the step held clears both (undo, EDIT + OCT−, is for the steps: it does not bring nudges and locks back). Locks and nudges are saved with the project and shown in the web editor (Sequencer tab, step detail).

**Fill conditions.** A step held + **OCT+** cycles its condition: *normal* → **FILL ONLY** (plays only during a fill) → **NO FILL** (silent during a fill) → normal. A fill is what you call while you play: hold **GLO** and hold white key **9** (*fill*) — the fill lasts as long as the key — or press key **10** (*bar*): the whole next bar plays as a fill, then it is over (press again before the bar to cancel). Build a beat whose rolls, crashes and pickup notes are FILL ONLY and whose main hat is NO FILL, and one finger brings the fill in and out on the bar. A skipped step is silent whole — no note, no MIDI, no ratchet, and no lock of its own (the sound goes back to its base, as at any step without a lock); the pattern runs on. On the drum track the condition is the step's, every sound in it. The tile of a FILL ONLY step carries a small **F** in its top left corner, a NO FILL step an **×** (the nudge / lock dot stays top right); the GLO tiles *fill* and *bar* light while they act. OCT− with the step held resets the condition with the nudge and locks; STOP ends any fill. Conditions are saved with the project and shown in the web editor (the step detail's *Fill* select, F / × on the grid). The arp and the rolls never mind a fill.

### SEL — key and chords

- **Any key** sets the **key of the song**: the root of all three synth tracks (*KEY D*).
- **KNOB 1 CHORD** (selected synth track): OFF, TRIAD, 7TH, 9TH (1-3-7-9, the lo-fi / R&B voicing), SUS4, POWER, **SUS2** (1-2-5), **ADD9** (1-3-5-9), **6TH** (1-3-5-6), **SHELL** (1-3-7). With a chord on, **the white keys walk the scale from C4** — C4 is the chord of the key's I, D4 the II, E4 the III… — and one finger plays the whole chord, recorded as a chord. With SCALE on CHR, the degree-based chords come from the minor scale. **OCTAVE** doubles the root; **MAJOR, MINOR, DOM7, MAJ7, MIN7, DIM, AUG, HALFDIM, DIM7** keep their fixed semitone quality on every root, regardless of scale.
- **CHORD+ (2.4, after HiChord and minichord): the black keys change the chord.** With a chord mode on, hold a black key while you play a white one — or press it while the chord is held, and the chord changes under your finger: **F#** major ↔ minor, **G#** adds the 7th, **A#** sus4, **C#** adds the 9th, **D#** an inversion (both octaves of black keys; hold several to combine them; the 7th and 9th come from the scale: in C major, G4 (the V chord, G) with G# is G7, with F# + G# Gm7). What you play is recorded as it sounds. For fixed-quality chords, F# flips the actual third, A# replaces it with a perfect fourth, and C# adds a major ninth. G# adds a major seventh to MAJOR/AUG, a diminished seventh to DIM, and a minor seventh to MINOR; existing sevenths stay unchanged. At four notes, the ninth replaces the fifth. POWER and OCTAVE accept inversion only; OCTAVE raises the whole pair by an octave when both notes fit below MIDI 128. On the **SEL 2** page: **STRUM** spreads a chord's notes like a strummed guitar (1–60 ms a note; right: low to high, left: high to low), on the keys and on the chord steps the sequencer plays; **VLEAD** ON voices each chord nearest the last one, so a progression moves smoothly instead of jumping.
- **KNOB 2 SCALE** for all synth tracks (16 scales: major, minor, dorian, mixolydian, pentatonics, harmonic, blues…).
- **KNOB 3 KEYS**: OFF (all keys chromatic), SNAP (every key rounded to the scale), WHITE (the white keys walk the scale, the black keys are silent).
- **KNOB 4 TRANSPOSE** the selected track, ±24 semitones.

Changing a sound (PRESETS, a user preset) never changes the key, the chord mode, the pattern or the mix of its track.

### Arpeggiator directions

On the **ARP** page, MODE includes **OUTIN** (alternate lowest/highest, then move inward), **SHUF** (each expanded note position once per random cycle), and **ROOTALT** (lowest note alternating with each other note). They use pitch order across the octave range and work with chord mode. ROOTALT follows the lowest voiced pitch, so inversion changes its anchor. **ORD** always follows key press order, independent of the ARP 2 ordering preference; UP, DN, and UPDN retain that preference. Swing, gate, hold, probability, recording, and MIDI output work through the existing arp path.

Also available: **DNUP** (down then up, no repeated endpoints), **UPDNREP** (up/down with both endpoints repeated), **INOUT** (middle outward), **WALK** (random adjacent-note movement, reflecting at the ends), and **PULSE** (the whole held chord across the selected octaves on each hit). They use pitch order. PULSE deduplicates overlapping pitches and applies gate, swing, probability, and hold to the whole chord; it starts simultaneously without STRUM. Every generated tone is released on mode changes, STOP, HOLD release, panic, and section changes. Held/latched input can continue running on the stopped arp clock. Internal voices remain subject to the shared eight-voice budget, and recorded steps still hold at most four notes (one in mono modes).

### GLO — mix

- White keys **1–4 mute** tracks 1–4 (a muted track fades out in a few ms and plays no new notes; its pattern runs on in time), keys **5–8 solo** them (several solos add up). The tiles show what is heard.
- The last white key (**G5**): **tap tempo** (two taps or more).
- **KNOB 1–4: the levels** of tracks 1–4.

## Undo, clear, save, autosave

- **Undo / redo:** hold EDIT, press OCT− / OCT+. One level: the last recording pass, erase, clear, step or pattern edit; redo takes it back again.
- **Clear a track:** hold REC. After 0.7 s the press is cancelled and a ring fills; keep holding ~1.3 s more and the selected track is cleared (*TRACK 2 CLEARED*). Let go before: nothing. Undo brings it back.
- **Save:** SAVE + keys 5–8 save the loop into section / project A–D (= SLOT 1–4); SAVE → PROJECT has SLOT, LOAD, SAVE too.
- **Autosave:** when the transport is stopped and you have not touched anything for 2.5 s (at most every 20 s), the working project is kept in flash; at power-on SLOOP comes back exactly as you left it.
- **New project:** SAVE → TOOLS → NEW (turn to GO): the four tracks back to their power-on sounds, empty patterns (undoable).

## Master: DUST, DUCK, FILT

On the whole mix, after the tracks' sends (FX + KNOB 1–3, or GLO → MASTER):

- **DUST** 0–100 %: the mix through an old sampler and a record — drive into a soft clip, a lower sample rate (down to ~11 kHz), fewer bits (down to 8), a low-pass closing to ~3 kHz, and while the transport plays a little hiss and crackle (a stopped SLOOP is silent).
- **DUCK** 0–100 %: every kick pumps the synth tracks down and back over an 1/8 note — the sidechain sound, in time at any tempo.
- **FILT**: a DJ filter. Left of centre a low-pass closing, right a high-pass opening, centre OFF. It glides (no zipper noise).
- **ROLL** (GLO → MASTER): the note-repeat rate of ARP + key.

## Punch-in effects

Hold **FX**, then hold a white key — the 16 white keys from the lowest F to the highest G. The effect runs on the whole mix while the key is held and lets go cleanly when you release it. Loops and the gate are locked to the tempo and start on the grid.

| Key | Effect | Key | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | loop 1/4 | 9 | low-pass sweep |
| 2 | loop 1/8 | 10 | high-pass sweep |
| 3 | loop 1/16 | 11 | phone |
| 4 | loop 1/32 | 12 | bit crush |
| 5 | stutter (1/16 triplets) | 13 | alias (sample-rate drop) |
| 6 | reverse | 14 | gate 1/16 |
| 7 | tape stop | 15 | echo (dotted 1/8) |
| 8 | half speed | 16 | tape wobble |

## Screens

- **TRACKS** (HOME) — the performance view: tempo, swing, transport, bar.beat; each track with its sound, its steps, the playhead, mute / solo / rec badges and its level. Dials: *swing · level · steps · pan* (KNOB 2 on a muted track unmutes it).
- **Layers** — while a layer button is held: 16 tiles (the white keys) and the knobs' dials, in the layer's colour.
- **DRUMS** (EDIT or SEQ tapped on TRACKS with the drum track) — **grid**: the 16 sounds × 16 steps, levels as shades, ratchets as notches; dials *sound · step · hit · level* (KNOB 1 plays the sound it picks, KNOB 2 the step it moves to). The **keys** are the steps of the sound: a white key sets its step (heard) or clears it, the first four black keys pick the page of steps (1–16 … 49–64); the keys light the sound's steps. **kit**: 16 pads that flash on every hit; dials *kit · level · reverb · pan*. EDIT / SEQ tapped, or SELECT, switches grid ↔ kit (the kit page: the keys play the pads).
- **REC READY / FREE TAKE** — while REC is armed: the tracks, then **mode**, **length** and **start** on KNOB 1–3 (4-3-2-1 during a count-in); during a free take: the seconds and the loop it makes.
- **Holds** — the ring of REC (clear) while held.
- **SONG** — the section chain.
- **Sound pages** (ENV, LFO, FX, SEL, EDIT, ARP, SEQ, GLO, SAVE) — the full synth, colour-coded.

## The sound bank

153 starting points for any style: house and techno, hip-hop, trap and plugg, drum & bass, amapiano, synthwave, lo-fi, ambient, soul. Every one is a full patch on one of the twelve engines: change it, save your own (32 user presets), or load your own samples. **PRESETS** browses them on a synth track **by kind** — basses, keys, organs, pads, leads, plucks and bells, stabs — the kind shown next to the name (the engine follows); your own presets come after. Every sound is level-matched: they all come out as loud at the same LEVEL. SLOOP starts (on a new project) at **90 BPM** with *808 BOOM* on track 1, *RHODES* on track 2, *LOFI FLUTE* on track 3 and the 808 kit on track 4.

The sampled sounds (SAMPLE engine, **SET**: PIANO (a grand), BASS, VIBES, HORNS, STRGS, FLUTE, SCRCH, PERC) are free recordings (CC0: Versilian Studios VSCO-2 CE and VCSL, Sonic Pi), retuned and coloured like a record through an old sampler.

### FM6: six-operator FM and DX7 patches

**FM6** is the classic six-operator FM synthesis — the sound of the DX7: electric pianos, bells, glassy pads, slap and round basses, brass. It is msfa, the synthesis core of Dexed, ported to whole-number arithmetic by Leo Kuroshita for Felucca 1.0. Each synth track playing FM6 has a full **patch**: six operators with their own four-stage envelopes, keyboard scaling, velocity, ratio or fixed frequency and detune; 32 algorithms, feedback, the LFO, the pitch envelope. FM6 plays six voices per track; its own envelopes shape every note, so the track's ADSR does nothing here.

On the FM-1, the eight **EDIT** values are macros on top of the patch:

| EDIT | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **ALG** | *PAT* = the patch's algorithm, 1–32 another one |
| **FB** | more feedback (0–7): brighter, then noisy |
| **MLVL** | the level of every modulator (−36 … +36 dB): the brightness |
| **MRAT** | the modulators' ratio up (ratio mode only): other harmonics |
| **MEG** | the modulators' envelopes slower (+) or faster (−) |
| **VMOD** | how much velocity brightens the note |
| **DTUN** | spreads the carriers apart in pitch: a chorused, wider sound |
| **PTCH** | loads a patch: **F1–F8** the factory ones, **B1–B27** your bank |

The track's FLT moves MLVL (so LFO → FLT and the matrix still brighten it), SHP the feedback, PIT the pitch.

**Your own patches** live in the web editor's **FM6** panel (Sound tab, when the selected track plays FM6): edit every operator, **Send to track** (it plays at once; tick *Send while editing* to hear every change), **Store in bank** (B1–B27, on the FM-1's flash; stop the song first). **Import SysEx** reads a DX7 file — one voice (163 bytes) or a 32-voice bank (4104 bytes, pick a voice), several in one file, and damaged ones as far as they go — so the thousands of DX7 and Dexed patches on the web play on the FM-1 (2.5: or drop the .syx file on the panel). **Store cartridge in bank** (2.5) stores a whole cartridge at once: tick up to 27 of its voices (the first 27 are ticked) and one write puts them in B1, B2… in order, after asking before it replaces anything; the rest of the bank stays. Choose **also add them to the user presets** and each voice gets a user preset with its name, playing its B slot: on the FM-1, PRESETS and SELECT find them by name. **Export SysEx** and **Export bank as SysEx** write them back for Dexed or a real DX7. A project keeps the track's PTCH, not the patch itself: a patch you sent is the track's until it loads another, so store it in the bank to keep it with the project. A user preset of an FM6 sound keeps the macros and PTCH the same way. The backup holds the bank.

## Drum kits

37 kits, and your own (USR1–USR4, USR3+4, and the synthesised SYN1–SYN4 of 2.5) — **PRESETS** on the drum track, KNOB 1 on the kit page, or the editor. 1–5 are a sampled acoustic kit (CC0 recordings of a real snare, hi-hat, toms and cymbals) and its treatments; 6–37 are synthesised, so they cost almost no memory. Every synthesised kit has 16 sounds of its own, one per white key — KICK 2 and SNARE 2 are other sounds, not the same one retuned (the long 808 in TRAP, the log drum in AMAPIANO, the rumble in TECHNO). Each sound is built like on the classic machines: a tuned body with a pitch drop and a hold before it fades, a second partial for the drum heads, a click for the attack, noise through a resonant filter, drive. Softer hits are darker as well as quieter. The levels are measured: every kit is as loud as the others, each sound at its place in the mix.

| # | Kit | Style | # | Kit | Style |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ACOUSTIC | studio | 20 | ELECTRO | electro |
| 2 | DEEP | soft | 21 | DISCO | disco |

| 19 | MINIMAL | minimal | | | |

The kit is saved with projects and song sections. MIDI notes in on the drum channel (10) play the nearest of the 16 sounds. Kits **38–42** are yours: **USR1–USR4** and **USR3+4** (below).

### Your own drum kits (KIT USR1–USR4, USR3+4)

A sample slot can be a drum kit: a sound of yours on each of the drum track's 16 lanes, one per white key (KICK on F3 … COWBELL on G5). Make it in the web editor, page **Drum kit**:

1. Drop WAV files on the **16 pads** (KICK, KICK 2, SNARE, CLAP, HAT, OPEN HAT, PEDAL, RIM, SNARE 2, LOW TOM, HI TOM, CRASH, RIDE, SHAKER, CONGA, COWBELL), or **Choose files** to add several at once: they are sorted onto the pads by their names (*kick*, *bd*, *snare*, *hh*, *open*, *crash*…; a second kick goes to KICK 2). Click a pad's wave to hear it.
2. Each pad has **Pitch** (±12 semitones), **Gain** and **Length** (a cut ends with a short fade, no click).
3. **Where it goes:** **USR3+4**, the big kit (about 15 s: the editor shares the sounds out over USR3 and USR4 by itself; USR1 and USR2 stay free for your instruments), or a single slot, **USR1**–**USR4** (about 7.4 s). Each choice shows what it holds now, and what a send would replace. The meter shows the time used of that space, at 22 kHz mono. Too long? Shorten the long sounds (crashes, open hats) or press **Fit the slot**.
4. Name it, **Send**. Then **Use … on the drum track** selects track 4 and sets its KIT (or turn KIT yourself: USR3+4 is the last one).

Everything the drum track does works with it: steps, levels, ratchets, fill conditions, the grid page, the keys, MIDI on the drum channel (a note plays its lane's sound), the track filter, the slicer, mute. The closed hat cuts the open one. A lane without a sound is silent, and so is an empty slot. A slot is a kit or an instrument, your choice: for example, USR1 and USR2 as instruments on tracks 1–3 (SAMPLE), and a big kit on USR3+4. **Save as ZIP** keeps the kit's 16 WAVs to share it; **Open ZIP** (or dropping a .zip) loads one back.

## Your own samples (USR1–USR4)

Four slots of about 7.4 s each hold your own sounds (USR4 from 2.4), played by a synth track: engine **SAMPLE**, **SET** = USR1 … USR4, or by the drum track as a kit (above). Load them from the web editor's **Samples** page, in three steps:

1. **Choose a slot.** Four tiles show what each slot holds (its name, how full it is); the page says when sending will replace something (or half of your USR3+4 kit).
2. **Make the sound**, one of two ways:
   - **From files (one note per file)**, for an instrument: drop WAV files (or click to choose them), up to 16, any rate, mono or stereo. Each plays at its own note, the keys between play the nearest one, pitched. The note is read from the file name (`KEYS_C4.wav`, C4 = 60) or set in the list; a keyboard picture shows which keys play which file; ▶ plays a file; the meter shows the time used of the slot.
   - **Chop a recording**, for a loop, a break or a phrase: one recording cut into pieces, one per key (CHOP, below).
3. **Send it and play it:** name it, **Send to USRn**, then **Play this slot on track 1, 2 or 3** sets that track to SAMPLE with SET = USRn for you.

- **CHOP:** open or drop a recording (WAV, MP3, AIFF…) and cut it into up to 16 chops, one per key — live with **TAP** (or the space bar) while it plays (*snap to the hit* puts each tap on its attack), **Find hits**, **Grid** or **Equal parts**; then keep the chops you want (the box on each chop, **Keep all**, **Keep none**, or **K**), set a chop's length (the slider under the chops, or drag the handle at the bottom of the wave; **Up to the next marker** undoes it) or press **Fit to slot** when they are too long together — a recording of any length works, the slot takes about 7.4 s of chops — then send it in step 3, or **Download WAVs** (the kept chops only, each with its own number).

## Song mode

A song is up to 16 steps of 4 sections, **A–D** (each holds the four tracks: sounds, patterns, kit). Make it live, by playing:

1. Make a loop (the verse). Hold **SAVE** and press the **5th white key** (*save A*). Change the loop (the chorus) and save it into **B** with the 6th key, a bridge into **C**, an end into **D**. Saving over a used section asks for the key again within 3 s.
2. **Play the sections live:** hold SAVE and press white key **1–4**. Playing, the section starts on the next bar, every track from its first step, always in time; stopped, it becomes the loop at once.
   **Quick chain:** keep SAVE held and tap more section keys — *A B B C*, any order, repeats allowed, up to 8 — then let go: the first plays on the next bar as usual, then each next one after the previous has played its **pattern length** (the longest track's: a 32-step 1/16 track is 2 bars), round and round. The title line reads *chain A B B C*, the section playing is lit, the next one framed. A single section tap, STOP, or PLAY in song mode ends the chain. SONG REC records what the chain plays.
3. **Record the song as you play it:** SAVE + key **14** (*rec*): from the next bar, every section you play and how many bars it plays are written into the song. Press it again, or STOP, to end: *SONG PARTS 5*. It is saved by itself once you stop.
4. **Play it back:** SAVE + key **13** switches *loop* / *song*; in song mode **PLAY** plays the whole song and stops at the end (your loop is back afterwards).

The **SONG screen** (SAVE tapped on TRACKS, or SAVE + key 16) shows the chain and edits it by hand: **KNOB 1** the step, **KNOB 2** its section, **KNOB 3** its bars, **KNOB 4** the number of steps; **REC** stores the loop into the step's section; **SAVE** (tap) saves the chain; **OCT−** loop / song; **OCT+ twice** loads a section. The four sections are the four project slots.

**Start fresh:** stop playback and SONG REC, hold **SAVE**, then press white key **9** (*new*) twice within 3 seconds. The first press asks *AGAIN: NEW*; releasing SAVE cancels. This uses the existing New Project action to clear the live loop and restore default sounds and tempo. Saved project/section slots remain intact.

## The web editor

Open it from the installer page, or with **`OPEN-EDITOR.bat`** (`http://localhost:8766/webapp/editor/`), in Chrome or Edge with the FM-1 on USB, and press **Connect**. It follows the device live (turn a knob on the FM-1, the editor moves).

It looks like the FM-1 (its black screen, the four track colours, its own Terminus font). The side bar has the pages — **Track**: Sound, Sequencer, Tracks; **Sounds**: Library, Samples, Drum kit; **Device**: Projects, Settings — and the FM-1's connection. On top: the page, the messages and the **four tracks** (number, sound, engine): click one to edit it; the selected track's colour is the editor's.

- **Sound** — every parameter of the selected track, as on the device: a card per button (ENV, LFO, EDIT, VOICE, FX, SEL, ARP), its pages as rows of four knobs, one colour per knob. Drag a value up or down like a knob (Shift: fine), or use its bar (click, then the wheel or the arrow keys; double-click: the default). The engines and presets, files; on an FM6 track the **FM6** panel (the patch, the bank, SysEx import and export).
- **Sequencer** — the pattern settings and the steps, as the device's tiles (click one; the **step list** below takes typed note names). On the **drum track**: a grid of the 16 sounds × the steps, with the **kit**. Choose a **level** (GHOST, SOFT, NORM, HARD) and a **roll** (x1–x4), then click: a hit; click it again (same level and roll): cleared; Shift+click: one level louder. Click a step (a cell of the grid, a drum column): its **nudge** and its **parameter locks** (add one, pick the parameter, set or delete it) below the grid; a step with either carries a mark.
- **Tracks** — the four channel strips (level, pan, mute; SOLO and REC shown as on the device).
- **Library**, **Samples** (with CHOP), **Drum kit** (your own kits, [above](#your-own-drum-kits-kit-usr1usr4-usr34)), **Projects**, **Settings** (GLOBAL, **MASTER**: DUST, DUCK, FILT, ROLL; DRUMS).
- **Backup** (Projects tab): **Save a backup** writes everything on the FM-1 to one file (SLOOP-backup-DATE.json): the music you are working on, the projects 1–4 (the song sections A–D), the 32 user presets, the FM6 bank, the samples USR1–USR4 (your drum kits with them) and the settings (colours, calibration, the song order, the lights, SYNC, MIDI OUT). **Restore from a file** puts it all back — what is on the FM-1 is replaced. A damaged file is refused before anything is written, every object is checked as a load checks it, and each one is written as a save writes it (a cut-off restore never leaves half an object). Stop the song (PLAY) before restoring.

The protocol is documented in [web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md](web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md) (v9). The editor writes presets and the FM6 bank to flash only while the song is stopped, as the FM-1 does.

## Sound design pages

The full Felucca engine is underneath: twelve synthesis engines (analog, 4-op FM, 6-op FM with DX7 patches, phase distortion, lo-fi chip, sampler, formant voice, three-oscillator, tonewheel organ, granular, physical models, noise), envelopes (with a pitch punch for the 808s), LFO, arpeggiator, scales and chords, glide and voice modes, per-track drive, slicer and HP / LP filter, chorus / delay / reverb sends (a stereo chorus, a tempo delay — 1/4 to 1/32, triplets, dotted 1/8 and 1/16 — a stereo reverb built as a feedback delay network: dense, no metallic ring), 32 user presets, 4 projects.

## MIDI keyboards

SLOOP takes MIDI from two places at once:

- **The MIDI IN jack** (3.5 mm TRS, on the FM-1): a keyboard or a pad controller with a MIDI output, through a TRS-to-DIN MIDI adapter. If nothing plays, try the other type of adapter (type A / type B).
- **USB**, from a computer or a phone (a DAW, a MIDI routing app) or a USB MIDI host box. A USB keyboard plugged straight into the FM-1 cannot work: both are USB devices, and a USB link needs a host.

| MIDI channel | Plays |
| --- | --- |
| 1, 2, 3 | synth tracks 1, 2, 3 |
| 10 | the drum track (the nearest of its 16 sounds; GLO → DRUMS → CH changes the channel) |
| 4–16 | the selected track: set your keyboard to channel 4 and it follows ALGORITHM |

**MIDI clock in:** GLO → SYSTEM → **SYNC** = **USB** or **TRS** (INT: SLOOP's own tempo). START plays from the top, CONTINUE carries on where it stopped, STOP stops; the tempo (BPM) follows the master, and the steps follow its 24 pulses a beat, so SLOOP cannot drift away from it. When the clock stops for half a second, PLAY on the FM-1 plays at its own tempo again. SYNC is a setting of the FM-1: it stays when you load a project.

**MIDI out:** what you play on the keys always goes out on USB MIDI (each track on its channel: 1–3 the synths, 10 the drums). GLO → SYSTEM → **MIDI** = **SEQ** sends what the sequencer, the arp and the rolls play too — every note is ended, STOP ends whatever was still on, and notes that came in from a computer or the jack are never sent back (no MIDI loop). Set a DAW track to record the FM-1's MIDI and you get the pattern as notes; or let SLOOP drive another synth. Like SYNC, MIDI is a setting of the FM-1. The SYSTEM page reads, on KNOB 1 to 4: **MIDI** (KEYS / SEQ), **SYNC**, **IN** and **CPU** (while no computer is connected: the **USB** link's state instead).

**MIDI CCs (2.5, the standard map of Felucca 1.1.5):** the knobs of a MIDI controller set the sound of the track the channel plays (as the notes), 0–127 over the parameter's range, as a knob would. Other CCs (mod wheel, sustain…) are ignored.

| CC | Sets |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | GLIDE |
| 7 | LEVEL (on the drum channel: GLO → DRUMS → LVL) |
| 10 | PAN |
| 71 | the engine's resonance (RES or Q: ANALOG, TRIO, VOICE, NOISE; the others ignore it) |
| 72 · 73 · 75 | release · attack · decay |
| 74 | the track's FILTER: 64 off, lower a low-pass, higher a high-pass (every engine, the drums too) |
| 91 · 93 · 94 | the reverb, chorus and delay sends (on the drum channel 91 and 94 are GLO → DRUMS → REV and DLY) |

**Clock only:** GLO → SYSTEM → **IN** = **CLOCK** makes SLOOP take only the clock and START / CONTINUE / STOP from MIDI, and ignore every incoming note (and CC) — for a DAW or a sequencer that sends notes to other gear on the same cable. **NOTES** (the default): notes and clock, as before. A note-off still gets through, so nothing held when you switch is left hanging. A setting of the FM-1, as SYNC.

Bluetooth MIDI is not supported: SLOOP, like Felucca, never switches the radio on.

## USB audio: record on a computer

On USB the FM-1 is also an audio input, named **Felucca**: 44.1 or 48 kHz (2.5: the host picks; phones and apps that only take 48 kHz work too), 16-bit stereo, class compliant, so no driver is needed. In your DAW or in Audacity, choose that input and record: you get the master output, exactly what the headphones play (after DUST, DUCK and FILT; the click and the count-in too, if they are on).

**Its level: HOME menu → USB AUDIO.**

- **MASTER** (default): the recording follows the MASTER knob, as the headphones do. Keep MASTER well up while you record.
- **FULL**: a fixed level, as with MASTER all the way up, kept from clipping by the output limiter, whatever the knob. MASTER then only sets the headphones: the right choice for an audio interface or a computer input with no level control of its own.

USB AUDIO is a setting of the FM-1: it stays as you left it. MIDI, the web editor and the installer keep working on the same cable while the computer records.

- The first time, the computer sees the FM-1 as a slightly different device (MIDI + audio) and sets it up again; the MIDI port keeps its name.
- The audio input comes from Felucca 1.0 (Leo Kuroshita): the same code, adapted to SLOOP.

## The visualiser

On the TRACKS screen, tap **HOME**: the whole screen becomes a visualiser of what SLOOP plays. **SELECT** steps through fourteen styles (the name shows a second; the last one chosen is kept with the settings); **HOME** again, or any page button, closes it. The keys, PLAY, REC and the layers work as ever (a layer held shows its screen, then the visualiser comes back); KNOB 1–4 do nothing meanwhile, and the tempo is GLO + SELECT.

| # | Style | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **OSCILLOSCOPE** | the mix's wave, standing still |
| 2 | **SPECTRUM** | 32 bands, lows to highs, with caps that fall |
| 3 | **SPECTROGRAM** | the spectrum scrolling down, black → blue → green → yellow → white |
| 4 | **LISSAJOUS** | the stereo image: the wider the cloud, the wider the sound |
| 5 | **VU METERS** | tracks 1–4 in their colours and the mix, with peak holds |
| 6 | **CIRCLE** | the wave round a ring that swells on every kick |
| 7 | **ORBIT** | four planets turning in 1, 2, 4 and 8 beats, sized by their track, round a sun that pulses with the mix |
| 8 | **WIRES** | a string per track, set swinging by its notes |
| 9 | **POLYRHYTHM** | four rings show each track's pattern length, active steps and independent playhead |
| 10 | **NOTE TRAILS** | scrolling pitches for all three synths, including chords and releases, with drum lanes below |
| 11 | **GROOVE** | eight steps per track: grid lines, swing, micro timing, hit levels and ratchet repeats |
| 12 | **STEREO FIELD** | a stereo cloud, left/right balance marker and a width bar |
| 13 | **SONG JOURNEY** | song order or quick chain, current entry and remaining bars |
| 14 | **BEAT TERRAIN** | spectrum-driven wireframe hills, moving at the tempo |

It sees the mix as if **MASTER** were all the way up, so the picture does not follow the volume knob: with MASTER turned down, even to 0, it moves as at full volume. It only reads what the audio already leaves for the screen (that mix, the tracks' levels and notes, the clock): it costs the sound nothing.

## Lights

Hold **HOME** for the menu: **LIGHTS**, **KEYS** and **NOTES** are together there (with **USB AUDIO**, the level of the USB audio input: see [USB audio](#usb-audio-record-on-a-computer), and **USB SERIAL**, a serial console for developers: OFF by default, as macOS 13–15 do not show the USB audio input while it is on; a change takes effect at the next start). The menu is in four sections, as the pages are — **SCREEN** (COLOR, ZOOM), **LIGHTS** (LIGHTS, KEYS, NOTES), **AUDIO** (LOWCUT, USB AUDIO, USB SERIAL), **SYSTEM** (HARDWARE CALIBRATION, ABOUT): **SELECT** goes from one to the next, **KNOB 1, 2, 3** set the section's rows (each row shows its knob's colour), PRESETS moves the cursor, OCT+ steps the cursor's setting round or opens it, OCT− closes. They are saved with the settings of the FM-1, not with a project: loading a project or NEW PROJECT does not change them.

- **LIGHTS** — OFF, LOW, MID, HIGH: every button glows at that level, so its label can be read in the dark (on a black FM-1 the labels are unreadable unlit). What is on — the page, PLAY, REC, an octave — stays at full light and still blinks as before.
- **KEYS** — OFF, C KEYS, WHITE KEYS, ALL KEYS: the Cs, every white key, or every key (2.4), glow at the LIGHTS level too (KEYS turns LIGHTS on at LOW if it was off). Played keys and the layer landmarks keep their own light.
- **NOTES** — ON: on the selected synth track, the notes sounding light their keys, played live or by the sequencer (the drum track always does). Since 2.4 a note lights its key for at least a tenth of a second, as a drum hit does, so the short notes of the sequencer show too. By @renebohne. It works on every page and in every layer: where the keys play or erase notes (EDIT, ARP, SAVE, SEL) the notes are lit — in SEL the scale and on the drum track in EDIT the sounds of the pattern then glow dimly underneath; where the keys are tiles (FX effects, SEQ steps, GLO mute / solo) the notes glow dimly and the tiles keep their full light.

The glow is a short pulse on every scan of the panel (about 900 times a second): no flicker. LOW, MID and HIGH are 0.5, 1 and 2 µs a scan; the landmarks (keys 1, 5, 9, 13 while a layer is held) and the notes under the tiles glow at 4 µs, a lit LED is about 95 µs.

## Rescue, going back, credits

- **USB rescue:** hold **OCT−** alone while switching on (*SLOOP USB RESCUE*), then install again.
- **Interrupted install:** the FM-1 stays in update mode; press Install again and it finishes. A damaged package is refused, and the FM-1 keeps waiting for a good one.
- **Back to the official firmware:** on the installer page, open **Return to the official firmware (V15)**: save a backup with the editor first, download FM-1 V15 from m-vave.com, select its FM-1.fwsc (only that exact file is accepted) and install it. M-VAVE's own updater, M-UPGRADE, works too (close every other app that uses MIDI first). To come back to SLOOP, install it again and restore your backup.

## Drum groove starters and mobile controls

Firmware 2.4.15 adds recorded chords feeding the arp: enable ARP on a synth, then
ARP 2 → ORD → SNOTE/SPLAY. TIE retains the input and REST clears the sequenced
contribution; live keys remain separate. NOTE/PLAY restore legacy direct sequence
playback, and ARP OFF plays the recorded steps directly. This is literal-note routing;
semantic chord followers remain future work.

On the drum track, cycle EDIT/SEQ through GRID, KIT and GROOVE. Choose a starter, then OCT+ applies while stopped; a nonempty pattern requires confirmation. OCT- toggles a non-destructive looping preview; during replacement confirmation it cancels. AMEN BREAK spans four bars. Hardware Undo restores the replaced pattern. Kit and global tempo stay selected. The phone Sequence workspace exposes the same bank when Drums is selected.

Firmware 2.4.12 also exposes leased phone fill/punch controls and USB return gain/mute/diagnostics. In chord mode, SCL page 2 knob 4 controls latch. Hold a physical chord and long-hold ARP or SEL (SLOOP SCL) for 700 ms to toggle latch while playing. Non-CHROM modifier keys toggle qualities until pressed again when latched, including with ARP enabled.

Firmware 2.4.16: a successful saved-project load, stopped section selection, or working-project backup restore keeps the previous complete project in RAM. While stopped, EDIT + OCT− undoes that load and EDIT + OCT+ redoes it. A later sequence edit or recording supersedes load history. Restart clears this recovery snapshot; it does not recover projects overwritten on older firmware.
