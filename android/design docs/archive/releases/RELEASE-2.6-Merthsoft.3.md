# Latest firmware — 2.6 Merthsoft.3

Upstream SLOOP 2.6 is integrated into the android branch. Local main and origin/main
match upstream revision 4365a1d; fork functionality remains on android.

- Upstream's 27 punch effects replace the former black-key FX modifiers. Remote
  performance negotiates sixteen or twenty-seven effects with the connected firmware.
- Track inserts, synced envelopes/LFOs, filter modes, texture, drum mutes,
  note length/velocity, MIDI sustain/bend/routing/learn and step entry are integrated.
- Native groove/progression libraries, independent starter rhythms, sequenced arps,
  physical latch gestures, scale guides/lights, editing tools, held/locked modulation,
  complete song-load undo and the Android/editor protocols are retained.
- FUN6 imports older projects and shifts engine locks correctly. Web backups include
  MIDI object 10. Android negotiates 61/53 or 71/63 parameter layouts, configured
  channels including OFF, and correctly routes optional bass.
- Factory drum definitions are losslessly shared; all 512 expanded sounds match.
  Startup uses a text title instead of the bitmap logo. Size compilation preserves
  hot DSP inlining, guarded against newly outlined per-sample helper calls.

Target image **581,096 bytes** (468 free); static RAM **94,452/98,304**
(3,852 free); pool **333,900/344,064** (10,164 free). Fully overwritten
scratch uses 8,800 bytes beside the flash driver, leaving 12,820 bytes there;
linker/build checks preserve an 8 KiB driver reserve. Stack guards are unchanged.
HAL and call-free RAM driver checks pass.

Package **609,941 bytes**, identity **FM-1_900**. SHA-256:
`f9736bceab60ac16e314f0a77b427ab1fd61c5324a6b7543a2cbbdf55d9e80be`.
Installer: http://127.0.0.1:8808/webapp/installer/

Host functional, serialization, UI, DSP and divide-by-zero checks pass. All 182
reviewed audio renders match, with zero health, voice/routing or crash failures.
The one LOFI arp fixture change preserves source velocity; forcing velocity 100
alone reproduces the exact upstream fixture. Android builds with zero warnings/errors;
web and companion domain tests pass. Hardware flashing/playback was not performed
in this integration session. Static instruction/call checks are not cycle measurements.

Unmarked settings words are interpreted as old fork settings. Upstream's old
channel-filter bits overlap fork visualizer/scale flags, so imported upstream
settings may need channel-filter re-selection. New settings have a format marker.
MIDI configuration is device-wide, not saved independently with each song.

The earlier intermittent song-save report remains unresolved. NOR round-trip tests
pass; no claim is made that its hardware cause has been fixed. A pre-existing
settings-write failure also lacks automatic retry; it remains follow-up work.
