# SLOOP 2.5 — The Complete Guide

Everything SLOOP does, every button, every combination, every page, in one place. This guide is written to be read from the top the first time, then used as a reference: the [cheat sheet](#26-cheat-sheet) at the end has every combination on one page.

SLOOP is a free, open-source (GPL-3.0) firmware for the M-VAVE FM-1, based on [Felucca](https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca) by Leo Kuroshita / Hügelton Instruments. The short manual is [SLOOP.md](SLOOP.md); the project page is [README.md](README.md).

## How to read this guide

| Written | Means |
| --- | --- |
| **tap FX** | press FX and let go without touching anything else (shorter than about half a second) |
| **hold FX** | keep FX pressed |
| **FX + key 3** | hold FX, and while it is held press white key 3 |
| **FX + KNOB 2** | hold FX, and while it is held turn KNOB 2 |
| **SEQ + step + KNOB 4** | hold SEQ, hold a step key, turn KNOB 4 |
| **key 1 … key 16** | the 16 white keys, from the lowest (**F3** = key 1) to the highest (**G5** = key 16) |
| **GO** | a value that does something (LOAD, SAVE, NEW…): turn it one click, *AGAIN: …* shows, turn it one more click within about 1.5 s to do it |

The 16 white keys, numbered:

| Key | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Note | F3 | G3 | A3 | B3 | C4 | D4 | E4 | F4 | G4 | A4 | B4 | C5 | D5 | E5 | F5 | G5 |

The 11 black keys are F#3, G#3, A#3, C#4, D#4, F#4, G#4, A#4, C#5, D#5, F#5. The "first four black keys" are F#3, G#3, A#3 and C#4.

## 1. Install and update

**From the browser (recommended).** Open the [installer page](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/) in **Chrome or Edge**, connect the FM-1 by USB (a data cable, plugged straight in, no hub), press **INSTALL**, allow MIDI access, and wait for *Done*. The FM-1 restarts on the SLOOP logo.

**From the source folder (Windows).** Double-click **`INSTALL-SLOOP.bat`**: it builds the firmware and opens the installer at `http://localhost:8766/webapp/installer/`. Keep the black window open until the install is done. **`OPEN-EDITOR.bat`** opens the web editor.

**Updating** keeps your projects, presets, samples, kits and settings. The installer checks the package (SHA-256), SLOOP's update loader checks it again (CRC) before it starts the new firmware, and a damaged package is refused before anything is written.

**Before you go back to an older SLOOP** (2.3 or earlier), save a backup in the editor: 2.3 cannot read 2.4 projects (format FUN5).

## 3. The big ideas: tracks, colours, tap and hold

### Four tracks

| Track | Colour | Plays | Knob of the same colour |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | blue | a synth (3 synth tracks share 8 voices) | KNOB 1 |
| **2** | green | a synth | KNOB 2 |
| **3** | yellow | a synth | KNOB 3 |
| **4** | orange | the drum machine: 16 sounds, one per white key | KNOB 4 |

**ALGORITHM** picks the track you play, record and edit, on every screen. The screen and the whole editor take the colour of the selected track. **White** on the screen always means *what you are touching*; **red** always means *recording*.

### Tap and hold

Every function button has two lives:

- **Tap** it: its **pages** open (sound design, settings), as on any FM-1 firmware. Tap it again: the next page of that button. **SELECT** also walks the pages of that button, both ways. Each button remembers the last page you used.
- **Hold** it: a **layer**. While it is held, the 16 white keys and KNOB 1–4 do something else, and after 0.14 s the screen shows the 16 keys as 16 tiles (four rows of four: keys 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, 13–16) and the knobs as dials. Let go: back to playing.

The layers are **FX** (punch-in effects), **EDIT** (erase), **ARP** (note repeat), **SEQ** (steps), **SEL** (key and chords), **GLO** (mix) and **SAVE** (song). ENV and LFO have no layer: they only open pages.

**Landmarks:** while a layer is held (and always on the drum track) keys 1, 5, 9 and 13 glow dimly — the first key of each row of tiles — so you can find a tile without looking. Keys at full light are what is on.

**Lock a layer:** hold its button and **tap HOME**. The layer stays open with the button let go (*LOCK* on the screen, the button blinks): both hands free, one on the keys, one on the knobs. Any other button lets it go (HOME, the layer's own button, ENV…) and does only that; **PLAY, REC and OCT− / OCT+ keep working** inside a locked layer.

**Inside any layer:** PLAY still starts and stops, **SELECT** is always the tempo, and the ALGORITHM / PRESETS knobs wait (no jump when you let go).

---

## 4. Your first beat in 60 seconds

1. Turn **ALGORITHM** to track **4** (orange). The white keys play 16 drum sounds: **F3 kick**, G3 kick 2, A3 snare, B3 clap, **C4 hat**, D4 open hat… Turn **PRESETS** to pick a kit: try *808* or *BOOMBAP*.
2. Press **REC** (*rec ready*). **Play a beat freely**, at your own tempo — no click, no count-in. Hold **OCT−** while you hit for ghost notes, **OCT+** for hard hits.
3. **Press REC on the "1" after your last bar.** The loop closes: its length sets the tempo, the hits snap to the grid, and it plays at once.
4. Press **REC** again while it plays: you record on top (overdub). Hold **ARP** and hold the hat key (C4): a 1/16 hat roll, recorded as ratchets.
5. Turn **ALGORITHM** to track **1** (blue, *808 BOOM*), press **REC**, play a bass line.
6. Hold **SEL** and press the key of your song (for example D). Select track 2, hold **SEL** and turn **KNOB 1** to *7TH*: every white key is now a chord of the key, one finger each.
7. Hold **FX** and hold a white key for a punch-in effect; still holding FX, turn **KNOB 2** for DUST, **KNOB 3** for DUCK.
8. A mistake? **EDIT + OCT−**: undo.

## 5. Every button, alone

| Control | Tap / turn | Hold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PLAY** | start / stop all tracks (in song mode: play the song). Works inside every layer | — |
| **REC** | playing: record now / stop recording · stopped: arm (*rec ready*) · free take: close the loop · count-in: cancel | ~2 s: **clear the selected track** (a ring fills; let go before it is full and nothing happens) |
| **SAVE** | on TRACKS or DRUMS: the **SONG** screen · on the SONG screen: save the song · elsewhere: the **SAVE pages** | the **song layer** (sections A–D, chain, song mode, SONG REC) |
| **HOME** | the **TRACKS** screen · on TRACKS: the **visualiser** (HOME again closes it) | 0.7 s: the **menu** (SCREEN, LIGHTS, AUDIO, SYSTEM); hold again to leave it |
| **ENV** | ENV pages (ENV, ENV DEST) | — |

| **ALGORITHM** | select track 1–4, on every screen (inside a layer it waits; not during a free take, on the SONG screen or in the menu) | — |
| **PRESETS** | on TRACKS, HOME and the PRESETS page: the selected track's **sound** (all factory sounds by kind, then your user presets) · drum track: the **kit** · on the DRUMS screen: the kit | — |
| **SELECT** | on TRACKS, inside a layer and on the REC screen: the **tempo** · on a page: previous / next page of its button (stops at the ends) · DRUMS screen: grid → kit → groove · visualiser: the style · menu: the section | — |
| **KNOB 1–4** | the four dials at the bottom of the screen | — |
| **MASTER** | output volume (the visualiser ignores it) | — |

### Combinations at power-on and while stopped

| Combination | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **OCT−** held while switching on | **USB rescue** (*SLOOP USB RESCUE*): install again from the browser |
| **OCT− + OCT+** held while switching on | **hardware calibration**: teach each button and knob (also in the HOME menu → SYSTEM) |
| **OCT− + OCT+** held 5 s, stopped | **update mode** (UBOOT): a countdown shows from 2 s; let go to cancel. Your work is saved first |

---

## 6. Playing the keys

### Synth tracks (1–3)

- The keys play the selected track. The notes you play always go out on USB MIDI (the track's channel).
- **OCT− / OCT+**: octave −3 … +3; both together: back to 0. The OCT lights show when you are off 0.
- What the keys play depends on the track's **KEYS** setting and **CHORD** mode (SEL layer or SEL page):

| KEYS | CHORD | The keys play |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OFF** | OFF | every key chromatic (the default) |
| **SNAP** | OFF | every key, rounded down to the scale |
| **WHITE** | OFF | the white keys walk the scale from C4 (C4 = the key's root); black keys are silent |
| **OFF / SNAP / WHITE** | **on** | the white keys play **chords** of the scale, one per key (C4 = the I chord); the black keys **change the chord** ([CHORD+](#chord-the-black-keys-change-the-chord)) |
| **CHROM** | **on** | every piano key plays a chord rooted on its actual note; black keys are roots rather than modifiers. OCT and TRN still apply; ROOT does not shift these literal keys. |
| **CHROM** | OFF | every key chromatic, like OFF |

On the SCL page, set **QNT / KEYS = CHROM** for chromatic chord roots. For example, choose
**CHORD = MAJOR** and press C# to play C# major. Fixed chord shapes retain their quality;
scale-derived shapes use the selected scale's tonic quality transposed to each root.
**SCALE = CHR** means all twelve semitones for ordinary notes, but legacy scale-derived
chords deliberately use minor harmony when CHR is selected. Choose an explicit MAJOR,
MINOR, DOM7, etc. for an unambiguous quality. Existing projects keep their key mapping.

- The **GM KIT** sound (SAMPLE engine) is the exception: the lowest key is a kick (C2), no scale.

### Drum track (4)

16 sounds, one per white key; a black key plays the sound of the white key on its left (two fingers on one sound, for fast rolls). Hold **OCT−** for ghost notes, **OCT+** for hard hits. See [The drum track](#7-the-drum-track).

### Velocity and levels

The FM-1's keys have no velocity: on the drum track every hit has one of four **levels** — **GHOST**, **SOFT**, **NORM** (as played), **HARD** — chosen with OCT− / OCT+ as you play, or later in the step sequencer. On synth tracks a step can carry an **accent** (STEP page, FLAG).

---

## 7. The drum track

### The 16 sounds

| Key | Sound | Key | Sound | Key | Sound | Key | Sound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 · F3 | KICK | 5 · C4 | HAT | 9 · G4 | SNARE 2 | 13 · D5 | RIDE |
| 2 · G3 | KICK 2 | 6 · D4 | OPEN HAT | 10 · A4 | LOW TOM | 14 · E5 | SHAKER |
| 3 · A3 | SNARE | 7 · E4 | PEDAL HAT | 11 · B4 | HI TOM | 15 · F5 | CONGA |
| 4 · B3 | CLAP | 8 · F4 | RIM | 12 · C5 | CRASH | 16 · G5 | COWBELL |

- **Levels:** GHOST, SOFT, NORM, HARD (hold OCT− / OCT+ while you hit). Softer hits are darker as well as quieter.
- **Ratchets:** a hit can repeat x1–x4 inside its step (ARP rolls record them; SEQ + step + KNOB 3 sets them).
- **Choke:** the closed hat and the pedal hat cut the open hat.
- **6 drum voices**, separate from the synths' 8.

### Kits

**PRESETS** on the drum track (or KNOB 1 on the DRUMS kit page, or the editor) picks the kit:

| # | Kits |
| --- | --- |
| 1–5 | **ACOUSTIC** (sampled studio kit, CC0) and its treatments: DEEP, TIGHT, BRIGHT, DUST |
| 6–37 | 32 synthesised kits, 16 sounds each: 808, 909, 606, 80S, VINTAGE, TRAP, DRILL, BOOMBAP, LO-FI, PHONK, HOUSE, D.HOUSE, TECHNO, MINIMAL, ELECTRO, DISCO, GARAGE, JUNGLE, DUBSTEP, DEMBOW, AMAPIANO, AFRO, LATIN, TRIBAL, SYNTHWV, CHIP, ARCADE, GLITCH, INDUSTR, HYPER, AMBIENT, JAZZ |
| 38–41 | **USR1, USR2, USR3, USR4**: your own kit in one sample slot (about 7.4 s) |
| 1 | **USR3+4**: your own big kit over two slots (about 15 s) |
| 43–46 | **SYN1, SYN2, SYN3, SYN4** (2.5): your own synthesised kits, made in the editor's [Drum synth](#your-own-synthesised-kits-syn1syn4) page. The FM-1 shows the name you gave them |

Every kit is level-matched. The kit is saved with projects and song sections. Changing the kit never touches the pattern. [Your own kits](#23-your-own-samples-and-drum-kits) work like any other: steps, levels, ratchets, fills, choke, MIDI.

### The DRUMS screen

Open it with **EDIT** or **SEQ** tapped on the TRACKS screen while the drum track is selected. It has three pages: **GRID**, **KIT**, **GROOVE**. **EDIT / SEQ tapped** cycles them; **SELECT** moves between them.

**Grid page** — the 16 sounds × 16 steps, levels as shades, ratchets as notches.

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| KNOB 1 **sound** | picks the sound (lane) — you hear it |
| KNOB 2 **step** | moves to a step — you hear what it holds |
| KNOB 3 **hit** | right: a hit of that sound on that step (NORM) · left: clear it |
| KNOB 4 **level** | the hit's level up / down (GHOST, SOFT, NORM, HARD) |
| **white keys** | the 16 steps of the sound KNOB 1 picks: press to set the step (you hear it), again to clear it; the keys light that sound's steps |
| **first four black keys** | the page of steps: 1–16, 17–32, 33–48, 49–64 |
| **PRESETS** | the kit |
| **SAVE** | the SONG screen |
| **HOME** | back to TRACKS |

**Kit page** — 16 pads that flash on every hit; the keys play the pads.

| KNOB 1 | KNOB 2 | KNOB 3 | KNOB 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **kit** | **level** of the drum track | **reverb** send of the drums | **pan** of the drum track |

While the song plays in song mode, the grid's hit and level knobs wait (*STOP THE SONG FIRST*).

**Groove page** — build a beat directly on the FM-1. Choose from 16 starters, including house, techno, disco, hip-hop, drum-and-bass, garage, reggaeton, bossa and AMEN BREAK / AMEN HALF. The screen previews kick, snare, clap and hats.

| KNOB 1 | KNOB 2 | KNOB 3 | KNOB 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **groove** starter | preview **step** | preview **sound** | **audition** that hit using the selected kit |

Press **OCT+** to **apply**; if the drum pattern contains anything, press **OCT+ again** to confirm replacement. **OCT− toggles a looping preview** through the current kit, without replacing your beat. During replacement confirmation, OCT− cancels and returns to GRID. Browsing leaves your pattern intact. Stop playback and recording first; an armed recording also blocks apply (*STOP FIRST*).

Apply replaces the drum steps, clears their ratchets, nudges, locks and fill conditions, and sets the starter's length and division. Most straight starters are 16 sixteenth-note steps; AMEN BREAK is 64 steps (four bars) and AMEN HALF is 32 steps (two bars). The preview grid follows the selected step in 16-step windows; SHUFFLE is 12 eighth-note triplet steps. Local drum swing becomes zero; global swing remains selected. The kit, mixer, tempo, song key and synth tracks stay selected. SMALL FILL repeats as an ordinary pattern. Edit any starter with GRID, SEQ or live recording, and save it as usual. **EDIT held + OCT− / OCT+** undoes/redoes replacement, including the overwritten timing and locks, while stopped.

---

## 8. Recording

SLOOP records live and layers every pass on top of the last (overdub). Notes go to the nearest step **as you heard it**: the ~12 ms between a key and its sound are taken back, so what you play on the beat lands on the beat. Chords are kept on the synth tracks (up to 4 notes a step); held notes become ties.

### What REC does

| When | REC does | Then |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Playing** | records the selected track **at once** | REC again stops recording; the loop plays on |
| **Stopped, project with notes** | arms (*rec ready*, the REC light blinks) | **your first note starts the loop and is step 1**; PLAY starts it too |
| **Stopped, empty project** | arms (*rec ready · play freely*) | a **free take**, or, with MODE *tempo*, as with notes |

REC again while armed disarms it (*REC OFF*). In **song mode**, REC waits until the song is stopped (*STOP THE SONG FIRST*), and arming REC switches back to loop mode.

While recording, the REC light is solid and the track shows a red *rec*. **Turn ALGORITHM** while recording and the take moves to the next track without stopping.

### The REC screen (armed, before the first note)

| Knob | Dial | Choices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KNOB 1 | **mode** (empty project only) | **free**: a free take, the tempo follows you · **tempo**: record at the tempo set (SELECT) |
| KNOB 2 | **length** | the selected track's loop: **1, 2 or 4 bars** |
| KNOB 3 | **start** | **note**: your first note starts the loop · **count**: press **PLAY**, one bar of clicks (4, 3, 2, 1 on the screen), then recording starts; notes before only sound |

LENGTH and START apply when you record at a tempo (MODE *tempo*, or a project that already has notes); a free take makes its own length. MODE and START are settings of the FM-1 (they stay as you left them). During the count-in, **REC cancels it** and **PLAY** goes back to *rec ready*. SELECT sets the tempo on this screen.

### Free take: the loop follows you

1. On an empty project, **REC**, then play freely. The screen shows *free take*, the seconds, and the loop it would make right now (*2 bars · 92 bpm*).
2. **Press REC on the "1" after your last bar.** SLOOP picks 1, 2 or 4 bars at the tempo nearest the one set (within 3 % the set tempo is kept), writes your notes with their lengths and levels, and plays the loop at once. All four tracks take that length.
3. **PLAY** during a free take drops it. A take closes by itself after 24 s.

### Metronome and swing

- The **PLAY light flashes on every beat**: a silent metronome.
- An audible click: **GLO → GLOBAL → CLICK** = **OFF**, **REC** (only while a track records) or **ON** (whenever it plays). It is a short tick of its own (higher on the first beat of a bar), heard with every kit, even with the drum track muted or another track soloed; its level follows GLO → DRUMS → LVL. The click is never recorded, and the count-in always clicks.
- **Swing** goes from **0** (straight) to **100** (the strongest: a step pair played 75 / 25, as MPC swing at 75 %): **HOME, KNOB 1** or **GLO → GLOBAL → SWING** for all tracks, **SEQ + KNOB 3** (or SEQ → PATTERN → SWG) per track; a track's swing adds to the global one. Triplet divisions are never swung.

### What gets recorded

- **Synth tracks:** the notes (and chords) with their lengths; ties for held notes; ARP rolls as ratchets; CHORD+ chords as they sound.
- **Drum track:** the hits with their levels; ARP rolls as **ratchets** (a 1/32 roll on a 1/16 track: x2 on each step).
- Never recorded: punch-in effects, the click, notes played in a layer that uses the keys for something else (FX, SEQ, GLO…).

## 9. The layers, one by one

All seven layers at a glance:

| Hold | Name | White keys | KNOB 1 | KNOB 2 | KNOB 3 | KNOB 4 | Tap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FX** | punch | a punch-in effect while the key is held | FILTER (master) | DUST | DUCK | TRK FILT (selected track) | FX pages |
| **EDIT** | erase | erase that sound / note from the pattern | SHIFT | LENGTH ×2 / ½ | TRANSPOSE | — | EDIT pages |
| **ARP** | roll | note repeat on the grid | RATE | — | — | — | ARP pages |
| **SEQ** | steps | steps 1–16 of the page | SOUND / NOTE | DIV | SWING | LENGTH | SEQ pages |
| **SEL** | key | the key of the song | CHORD | SCALE | KEYS | TRANSPOSE | SEL pages |
| **GLO** | mix | 1–4 mute · 5–8 solo · 9 fill · 10 fill bar · 16 tap tempo | level 1 | level 2 | level 3 | level 4 | GLO pages |
| **SAVE** | song | 1–4 play A–D · 5–8 save A–D · 13 loop / song · 14 SONG REC · 16 song screen | — | — | — | — | song screen / SAVE pages |

### FX — punch

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **FX + key 1–16** | the [punch-in effect](#punch-in-effects) of that key, on the whole mix, for as long as the key is held |
| **FX + KNOB 1** | master **FILTER**: left a low-pass, right a high-pass, centre off |
| **FX + KNOB 2** | master **DUST** (old sampler and vinyl) |
| **FX + KNOB 3** | master **DUCK** (sidechain pump from the kick) |
| **FX + KNOB 4** | **TRK FILT**: the same one-knob filter on the **selected track only** (any track, the drums too) |
| **FX + HOME** | lock the FX layer open (both hands free) |

Keys pressed while FX is held never play or record notes.

### EDIT — erase

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **EDIT + key**, playing | erases that sound (drums) or note (synths; with CHORD on, its chord) from **every step the playhead passes while you hold the key** — MPC style: hold the hat key for one bar and that bar's hats are gone. *ERASED* flashes |
| **EDIT + key**, stopped | erases that sound / note from the **whole pattern** at once |
| **EDIT + KNOB 1** | **SHIFT**: every step one later (right) / earlier (left) — turns the groove around |
| **EDIT + KNOB 2** | **LENGTH**: right ×2 (the pattern copied after itself, up to 64 steps), left ½ |
| **EDIT + KNOB 3** | **TRANSPOSE**: every note a semitone up / down (synth tracks) |
| **EDIT + OCT−** | **undo** |
| **EDIT + OCT+** | **redo** |

All the knob turns of one EDIT hold count as one change for undo.

### ARP — roll (note repeat)

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **ARP + key (held)** | the key repeats on the grid at the RATE, locked to the tempo and the swing; it ends with the key |
| **ARP + KNOB 1** | **RATE**: 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 32T, 1/64 (also GLO → MASTER → ROLL) |
| **ARP + key + OCT− / OCT+** | on the drum track: ghost / hard rolls |

While recording, a roll is written as ratchets (a 1/32 roll on a 1/16 track: x2 on each step). Rolls ignore fills. (The **arpeggiator** is something else: tap ARP for its pages.)

### SEQ — steps

The 16 white keys are the 16 steps of the current page; the lit ones play.

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **SEQ + empty step** | sets it at once — drums: with the sound shown (KNOB 1, or the last pad you hit); synths: with the note or chord you played last |
| **SEQ + set step (tap)** | clears it (with its nudge, locks and fill condition) |
| **SEQ + several step keys held** | edit them together |
| **SEQ + first four black keys** or **SEQ + OCT− / OCT+** (no step held) | the page: steps 1–16, 17–32, 33–48, 49–64 (up to the track's length) |
| **SEQ + KNOB 1** (no step held) | the **sound** (drums, you hear it) / **note** to set |
| **SEQ + KNOB 2** | **DIV**: 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 8T, 16T, 1/2, 1BAR, 2BAR |
| **SEQ + KNOB 3** | **SWING** of the track |
| **SEQ + KNOB 4** | **LENGTH**: 1–64 steps |
| **SEQ + step + KNOB 1** | drums: which **sound** of the step LEVEL and RATCHET edit (you hear it) · synths: the step's **note** (every note of a chord moves together) |
| **SEQ + step + KNOB 2** | **LEVEL**: ghost, soft, norm, hard |
| **SEQ + step + KNOB 3** | **RATCHET**: x1–x4 |
| **SEQ + step + KNOB 4** | **NUDGE**: −32 … +31 (in 1/64 of a step) |
| **SEQ + step + PRESETS** | a **parameter lock** on that step: the first click makes it one click away from the track's value, the next ones move it |
| **SEQ + step + ALGORITHM** | which parameter the lock is on |
| **SEQ + step + OCT+** | the step's **fill condition**: normal → FILL ONLY → NO FILL → normal |
| **SEQ + step + OCT−** | clears the step's nudge, locks and fill condition |

A held step that you edited with a knob is **kept** when you let go (only a plain tap clears). Details in [The step sequencer](#10-the-step-sequencer-steps-nudge-locks-fills).

### SEL — key and chords

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **SEL + any key** | sets the **key of the song**: the root of all three synth tracks (*KEY D*) |
| **SEL + KNOB 1** | **CHORD** of the selected synth track: OFF, TRIAD, 7TH, 9TH, SUS4, POWER, SUS2, ADD9, 6TH, SHELL, OCTAVE, MAJOR, MINOR, DOM7, MAJ7, MIN7, DIM, AUG, HALFDIM, DIM7 |
| **SEL + KNOB 2** | **SCALE** of all three synth tracks: 16 scales |
| **SEL + KNOB 3** | **KEYS**: OFF, SNAP, WHITE |
| **SEL + KNOB 4** | **TRANSPOSE** the selected track, ±24 semitones |

Details in [Key, scales, chords and CHORD+](#11-key-scales-chords-and-chord).

### GLO — mix

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **GLO + key 1–4** | **mute** / unmute track 1–4 (fades out in a few ms; the pattern runs on in time) |
| **GLO + key 5–8** | **solo** track 1–4 (several solos add up) |
| **GLO + key 9 (held)** | **fill** for as long as the key is held |
| **GLO + key 10** | **fill bar**: the whole next bar plays as a fill (press again before the bar to cancel) |
| **GLO + key 16** | **tap tempo** (two taps or more) |
| **GLO + KNOB 1–4** | the **levels** of tracks 1–4 |
| **GLO + SELECT** | the tempo (also inside the visualiser) |

The tiles show what is heard; the *fill* and *bar* tiles light while they act.

### SAVE — song

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **SAVE + key 1–4** | play section **A–D**: playing, from the next bar (every track from its first step); stopped, it becomes the loop at once |
| **SAVE + key 1–4, several tapped while SAVE stays held** | a **quick chain** (*A B B C*…, up to 8, repeats allowed): let go and they play in turn, round and round |
| **SAVE + key 5–8** | **save the loop** into section A–D (over a used section: press the key again within 3 s) |
| **SAVE + key 9** | **new** live project: stopped, press twice within 3 s while SAVE stays held; clears the current loop and restores default sounds/tempo, preserving saved slots |
| **SAVE + key 13** | switch **loop** / **song** mode |
| **SAVE + key 14** | **SONG REC**: from the next bar, every section you play (and how long) is written into the song; again (or STOP) to end |
| **SAVE + key 16** | the **SONG** screen |

Details in [Song mode](#14-song-mode-sections-chains-songs).

## 10. The step sequencer: steps, nudge, locks, fills

Each track has up to **64 steps** with its own **length** (1–64) and **division** (1/32 to two bars). Tracks of different lengths loop on their own and stay in phase (polymeters). A synth step holds up to 4 notes (a chord) with a level and ratchet, a tie or a rest, an accent and a slide; a drum step holds any of the 16 sounds, each with its own level and ratchet.

There are three ways to enter steps:

1. **Live** — REC and play (see [Recording](#8-recording)).
2. **The SEQ layer** — hold SEQ, the white keys are steps (all tracks; see [SEQ — steps](#seq--steps)).
3. **The STEP page** (synth tracks) — tap **SEQ**: the step under the cursor is written from the keys, acid style:

| STEP page | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **keys** | the keys pressed together become the cursor's step (POLY: up to 4 notes; MONO, LEG and UNI: the last one); in chord mode a key writes its whole chord, CHORD+ changes included; let go of all keys and the cursor moves on |
| KNOB 1 **STEP** | moves the cursor |
| KNOB 2 **NOTE** | transposes the step (an empty step gets your last note) |
| KNOB 3 **TIME** | **NOTE**, **TIE** (holds the previous note on) or **REST** |
| KNOB 4 **FLAG** | **–**, **ACC** (accent), **SLD** (slide to the next note), **A+S** (both) |
| **EDIT (tap)** | clears the cursor's step and moves on |

Not while recording or armed (the keys record live then). On the drum track, the STEP page shows *DRUM TRACK*: use the DRUMS grid or the SEQ layer.

The **PATTERN** page (tap SEQ again) holds the track's **LEN**, **DIV**, **SWG** (swing) and **GATE** (how long each note lasts).

### Nudge (micro timing)

**SEQ + step + KNOB 4** moves a step off the grid, from −32 to +31 in 1/64 of a step: minus = early (the step plays before its grid time, inside the previous step), plus = late. Its ratchets move with it; recording and swing stay on the grid. On the drum track the whole step moves, every sound in it. A nudged step shows a dot in the corner of its tile.

### Parameter locks

A **lock** gives one sound parameter another value **for that step only** (Elektron style).

1. Turn the parameter you want on its page (for example FX → DLY send, or LFO → RATE). That becomes the **lock parameter** (before you turn anything it is ENV DEST → FLT).
2. Hold **SEQ** and hold the step.
3. Turn **PRESETS**: the first click makes the lock, one click away from the track's value; the next ones move it. The title line shows it (*lock dst 14*; *lock flt --* = no lock yet).
4. **ALGORITHM** (step still held) steps through the other parameters, wrapping round.

At the next step without a lock on that parameter, it comes back to its base value (notes still ringing follow). A knob turned on the page while a lock is in force wins: that value becomes the new base. Several locks can sit on one step (one per parameter), **24 per track**. The sound parameters of the track can be locked (and the PATTERN page's GATE); the arp, key / scale / chord, STRUM / VLEAD, voice-mode, MUTE, LEN / DIV / SWG and the global pages cannot (*NOT LOCKABLE*; *NO LOCK LEFT* when the 24 are used). A locked step shows the same dot as a nudged one; **SEQ + step + OCT−** clears both. Undo (EDIT + OCT−) is for steps: it does not bring nudges and locks back.

### Fill conditions

**SEQ + step + OCT+** cycles the step's condition:

| Condition | Mark on the tile | Plays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **normal** | — | always |
| **FILL ONLY** | small **F** (top left) | only during a fill |
| **NO FILL** | **×** (top left) | always, except during a fill |

Call a fill while you play: **GLO + key 9** (as long as you hold it) or **GLO + key 10** (the whole next bar). Build a beat whose rolls, crashes and pickup notes are FILL ONLY and whose main hat is NO FILL: one finger brings the fill in and out on the bar. A skipped step is silent whole (no note, no MIDI, no ratchet, no lock). On the drum track the condition is the step's, every sound in it. STOP ends any fill. The arp and the rolls ignore fills.

### Divisions

**DIV**: 1/4, 1/8, **1/16** (default), 1/32, 8T, 16T (triplets), **1/2**, **1BAR**, **2BAR**. A 64-step track at 2BAR lasts 128 bars: drones, chord changes, slow songs.

---

## 11. Key, scales, chords and CHORD+

### Key and scale

- **SEL + any key** sets the **key of the song** for the three synth tracks. (Also SEL page → ROOT, per track.)
- **SCALE** (SEL + KNOB 2 sets all three synth tracks; the SEL page sets the selected track alone): CHR (chromatic), MAJ, MIN, DOR (dorian), MIX (mixolydian), PEN (major pentatonic), MPEN (minor pentatonic), HARM (harmonic minor), PHRY (phrygian), LYD (lydian), LOC (locrian), MEL (melodic minor), BLUES, WHOLE (whole tone), DIMHW and DIMWH (diminished, half-whole and whole-half).
- **KEYS**: **OFF** (chromatic), **SNAP** (every key rounded down to the scale), **WHITE** (the white keys walk the scale from C4, the black keys are silent).
- **TRANSPOSE** (per track): ±24 semitones.

Changing a sound (PRESETS, a user preset) never changes the key, the chord mode, the pattern or the mix of its track.

### Chord mode: one finger, one chord

Hold **SEL** and turn **KNOB 1 CHORD** on the selected synth track:

| CHORD | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **OFF** | single notes |
| **TRIAD** | 1-3-5 |
| **7TH** | 1-3-5-7 |
| **9TH** | 1-3-7-9 (the lo-fi / R&B voicing) |
| **SUS4** | 1-4-5 |
| **POWER** | 1-5-8 (root, fifth, octave) |
| **SUS2** | 1-2-5 |
| **ADD9** | 1-3-5-9 (keeps the fifth; unlike 9TH, has no seventh) |
| **6TH** | 1-3-5-6 |
| **SHELL** | 1-3-7 (leaves the fifth out) |
| **OCTAVE** | root + 12 semitones |
| **MAJOR / MINOR** | 0-4-7 / 0-3-7 semitones |
| **DOM7 / MAJ7 / MIN7** | 0-4-7-10 / 0-4-7-11 / 0-3-7-10 |
| **DIM / AUG** | 0-3-6 / 0-4-8 |
| **HALFDIM / DIM7** | 0-3-6-10 / 0-3-6-9 |

With a chord on, **the white keys walk the scale from C4**: C4 plays the chord of the key's I, D4 the II, E4 the III… and the keys below C4 carry on downwards. TRIAD through SHELL use scale degrees (POWER uses a perfect fifth and octave). With SCALE on CHR, these degree-based chords use the minor scale. OCTAVE and MAJOR through DIM7 use fixed semitone intervals, so their quality stays the same on every key; the scale still selects each root. One finger plays the whole chord, and it is recorded as a chord.

### CHORD+: the black keys change the chord

With a chord mode on, **hold a black key while you play a white one** — or press it while the chord is held, and the chord changes under your finger:

| Black key | Changes the chord |
| --- | --- |
| **F#** | major ↔ minor |
| **G#** | adds the 7th |
| **A#** | sus4 |
| **C#** | adds the 9th |
| **D#** | an inversion |

Both octaves of black keys work, and you can hold several. The 7th and 9th come from the scale: in C major, G4 plays **G** (the V chord), **G#** makes it **G7**, **F# + G#** make it **Gm7**; on C4, F# + G# give C-E♭-G-B. What you play is recorded as it sounds. For fixed-quality chords, F# flips the actual third, A# replaces it with a perfect fourth, and C# adds a major ninth. G# adds a major seventh to MAJOR/AUG, a diminished seventh to DIM, and a minor seventh to MINOR; existing sevenths stay unchanged. At four notes, the ninth replaces the fifth. POWER and OCTAVE accept inversion only; OCTAVE raises the whole pair by an octave when both notes fit below MIDI 128.

### SEL 2: STRUM and VLEAD

Tap **SEL** twice (or SEL, then SELECT) for **SEL 2**:

| Knob | Does |
| --- | --- |
| KNOB 1 **TRN** | transpose the track, ±24 semitones |
| KNOB 2 **STRUM** | plays a chord's notes one after the other like a strummed guitar, 1–60 ms a note: right = low to high, left = high to low, centre = off. On the keys and on the chord steps the sequencer plays |
| KNOB 3 **VLEAD** | **ON**: voice leading — each chord is voiced nearest the last one, so a progression moves smoothly instead of jumping |
| KNOB 4 **LATCH** | **ON**: sustain a keyboard chord after release; the next root replaces it. Outside CHROM, black-key modifiers toggle until pressed again, including with ARP enabled and the root retained. OFF or STOP releases the latched chord. Shares ARP HOLD. Hold an existing chord plus **ARP**, or physical **SEL/SLOOP SCL**, for **700 ms** to toggle latch without restarting the chord. This also captures manually played arpeggio notes with CHORD OFF; a second button hold toggles latch off while the physical keys keep playing. |

---

## 12. Mix: levels, mute, solo, fills, tap tempo

| Where | What |
| --- | --- |
| **GLO + KNOB 1–4** | levels of tracks 1–4 |
| **TRACKS screen, KNOB 2** | the selected track's level (on a muted track: unmutes it) |
| **GLO + keys 1–4 / 5–8** | mute / solo |
| **VOICE 2 page** | PAN and MUTE of a synth track |
| **TRACKS screen, KNOB 4** | the selected track's pan |
| **GLO → DRUMS** | the drum track's LVL, its reverb and (2.5) delay sends, and its MIDI channel |
| **MASTER knob** | the output volume |

A muted track fades out in a few milliseconds and plays no new notes; its pattern runs on in time. Several solos add up.

**Tempo:** SELECT on TRACKS (or inside any layer), **GLO + key 16** tap tempo, or GLO → GLOBAL → BPM (40–240). With MIDI SYNC on, the tempo follows the master.

---

## 13. Undo, clear, save, projects, autosave

| Action | How |
| --- | --- |
| **Undo / redo** | **EDIT + OCT−** / **EDIT + OCT+**. One level: the last recording pass, erase, clear, step or pattern edit |
| **Undo an accidental load** | Firmware 2.4.16: stop playback, hold **EDIT**, press **OCT−** to restore the complete project from before the latest successful load; **OCT+** redoes the load. Saved-slot loads, stopped section selection and working-project backup restore are covered. A later sequence edit/recording takes over undo history. This snapshot lives in RAM and is lost at restart; failed/empty loads leave it intact |
| **Clear the selected track** | **hold REC** ~2 s (after 0.7 s a ring fills; let go before it is full: nothing). Undo brings it back |
| **Clear the pattern** | SAVE → TOOLS → **CLRSQ** (GO) |
| **Reset the sound** | SAVE → TOOLS → **INIT** (GO): the engine's defaults and first preset |
| **New project** | SAVE → TOOLS → **NEW** (GO): the four tracks back to their power-on sounds, empty patterns, 90 BPM (stop the song first in song mode; undo brings back only the last track's pattern, so save a section first if in doubt) |
| **Save the loop as a section / project** | **SAVE + key 5–8** (A–D = project slots 1–4) |
| **Save / load a project** | SAVE → PROJECT: **SLOT** 1–4, **LOAD** (GO), **SAVE** (GO) |
| **Save a sound** | SAVE → USER: **SLOT** (1–32), **SAVE** (GO) |
| **Autosave** | automatic: when the transport is stopped and you have not touched anything for 2.5 s (at most every 20 s), the working project is kept in flash; at power-on SLOOP comes back exactly as you left it |

A **project** keeps the four tracks (sounds, patterns, kit, locks, nudges, fill conditions, the track filter) and the global settings of the song (tempo, swing, key…). **Settings of the FM-1** — SYNC, MIDI OUT, IN, the lights, the menu settings, the REC screen's MODE and START — are not part of a project: loading a project or NEW PROJECT never changes them.

### The SAVE pages (SAVE tapped, not on TRACKS)

| Page | KNOB 1 | KNOB 2 | KNOB 3 | KNOB 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PRESETS** | the sound (factory by kind, then user presets) | the engine (next / previous) | — | — |
| **USER** | **SLOT** 1–32 | **LOAD** (GO) | **ERASE** (GO) | **SAVE** (GO) |
| **PROJECT** | **SLOT** 1–4 | — | **LOAD** (GO) | **SAVE** (GO) |
| **TOOLS** | **CLRSQ** (GO) | **INIT** (GO) | — | **NEW** (GO) |

GO: one click shows *AGAIN: SAVE* (or LOAD…), a second click within about 1.5 s does it. Presets and projects are written to flash only while the song is stopped.

---

## 14. Song mode: sections, chains, songs

A song is up to **16 steps** of **4 sections, A–D**. Each section holds the four tracks (sounds, patterns, kit) and is one of the four project slots.

### Make it live, by playing

1. Make a loop (the verse). **SAVE + key 5**: *save A*. Change the loop (the chorus) and save it into **B** (key 6), a bridge into **C** (key 7), an ending into **D** (key 8). Saving over a used section asks for the key again within 3 s.
2. **Play the sections live: SAVE + key 1–4.** Playing: the section starts on the next bar, every track from its first step, always in time. Stopped: it becomes the loop at once.
3. **Quick chain:** keep SAVE held and tap several section keys — *A B B C*, any order, repeats allowed, up to 8 — then let go. The first plays on the next bar, then each next one after the previous has played its **pattern length** (the longest track's), round and round. The title line reads *chain A B B C*; the section playing is lit, the next one framed. A single section tap, STOP, or PLAY in song mode ends the chain.
4. **Record the song as you play it: SAVE + key 14.** From the next bar every section you play, and for how many bars, is written into the song. SAVE + key 14 again, or STOP, ends it (*SONG PARTS 5*). It is saved by itself once you stop. SONG REC records what a chain plays too.
5. **Play it back:** **SAVE + key 13** switches *loop* / *song*. In song mode **PLAY** plays the whole song and stops at the end (your loop is back afterwards).

### The SONG screen

Open it with **SAVE tapped on TRACKS** (or on DRUMS), or **SAVE + key 16**. It shows the chain and edits it by hand:

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| KNOB 1 | the song step (cursor) |
| KNOB 2 | that step's section (A–D) |
| KNOB 3 | its length in bars (1–64) |
| KNOB 4 | the number of steps in the song (1–16) |
| **REC** | stores the current loop into the step's section (a used section: REC again within 3 s) |
| **SAVE** (tap) | saves the song |
| **OCT−** | loop / song mode |
| **OCT+** twice (within 3 s) | loads the step's section (unsaved work is replaced) |
| **PLAY** | play / stop |
| **SEQ** | the SEQ pages |
| **HOME** | back to TRACKS |

The song's settings can only be edited while it is stopped (*STOP FIRST*). An empty section cannot play (*EMPTY SECTION: REC*).

## 15. The screens

| Screen | How to get there | What it shows · what the knobs do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **TRACKS** | tap **HOME** | the performance view: tempo, swing, transport, bar.beat; each track with its sound, steps, playhead, mute / solo / rec badges and level. Dials: KNOB 1 **swing** (global) · KNOB 2 **level** (selected track; on a muted track: unmutes it) · KNOB 3 **steps** (its length) · KNOB 4 **pan** |
| **Visualiser** | tap **HOME** on TRACKS | twenty-one full-screen visualisers; see [The visualiser](#19-the-visualiser) |
| **Layer** | hold a layer button | 16 tiles (the white keys) and the four dials, in the layer's colour |
| **DRUMS** (grid / kit / groove) | tap **EDIT** or **SEQ** on TRACKS with the drum track | see [The DRUMS screen](#the-drums-screen) |
| **REC READY / FREE TAKE / COUNT-IN** | **REC** while stopped | the tracks, then **mode · length · start** on KNOB 1–3 (4-3-2-1 during a count-in); in a free take: the seconds and the loop it would make |
| **Hold ring** | hold **REC** | the ring of *clear track* filling |
| **SONG** | tap **SAVE** on TRACKS, or **SAVE + key 16** | the section chain; see [The SONG screen](#the-song-screen) |
| **Pages** | tap ENV, LFO, FX, SEL, EDIT, ARP, SEQ, GLO, SAVE | four colour-coded values with a graph (ENV, LFO, ARP, SEL, FX, SLICER…), or the four values in large type placed as the knobs are (1 2 / 3 4) |
| **Menu** | hold **HOME** | the settings of the FM-1 in four sections; see [The HOME menu](#20-the-home-menu-and-the-lights) |

The **title line** of every screen also carries short messages: *KEY D*, *ERASED*, *AGAIN: SAVE*, *NEXT: B*, *chain A B B C*, *lock flt 12*…

---

## 16. Every page, knob by knob

Tap a button to open its first page (or the last one you used); **tap it again** for its next page, or turn **SELECT** to go back and forth. On the drum track, pages that do not apply to it show *DRUM TRACK*.

| Button | Page | KNOB 1 | KNOB 2 | KNOB 3 | KNOB 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ENV** | **ENV** | ATK attack | DEC decay | SUS sustain | REL release |
| | **ENV DEST** | FLT: envelope → brightness (±) | PIT: envelope → pitch (±, the 808 punch) | SHP: envelope → the engine's shape (±) | — |
| **LFO** | **LFO** | RATE (Hz) | WAVE: SIN, TRI, SAW, SQR, S&H | PHS phase | FADE (fade-in time) |
| | **LFO DEST** | PIT: vibrato | FLT: filter wobble | SHP: shape | AMP: tremolo |
| **FX** | **FX** (sends) | DST drive | CHO chorus send | DLY delay send | REV reverb send |
| | **FILTER** | FILT: one-knob filter of the track — left LP, right HP, centre OFF | — | — | — |
| | **SLICER** | SLCR: OFF, GATE, STUT (stutter) | PAT: pattern 1–16 | RATE: 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 8T, 16T, 32T | DEPTH |
| | **DLY** (global) | TIME: 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 8T, 16T, 1/8D, 1/16D | FDBK feedback | COLR colour (tone of the repeats) | MIX |
| | **REV/CHO** (global) | SIZE reverb size | DAMP reverb damping | CRT chorus rate | CDP chorus depth |
| **SEL** | **SEL** | ROOT (the track's key) | SEL: the track's scale (SEL + KNOB 2 sets all three) | QNT keys: OFF, SNAP, WHITE | CHORD: OFF, TRIAD, 7TH, 9TH, SUS4, POWER, SUS2, ADD9, 6TH, SHELL, OCTAVE, MAJOR, MINOR, DOM7, MAJ7, MIN7, DIM, AUG, HALFDIM, DIM7 |
| | **SEL 2** | TRN transpose ±24 | STRUM ±60 ms | VLEAD: OFF / ON | LATCH: OFF / ON |
| **EDIT** | **EDIT 1** | engine parameter 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 (see [the engines](#the-twelve-engines)) |
| | **EDIT 2** | engine parameter 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| | **VOICE** | VCE: POLY, MONO, LEG (legato), UNI (unison) | GLD glide | GLMOD: RATE / TIME | PRIO: LAST, LOW, HIGH (mono note priority) |
| | **VOICE 2** | ALLOC: ROT (rotate) / REUSE | DTUNE (unison detune) | PAN | MUTE |
| **ARP** | **ARP** | MODE: OFF, UP, DN, UPDN, RND, ORD, OUTIN, SHUF, ROOTALT, DNUP, UPDNREP, INOUT, WALK, PULSE | RATE: 1/4 … 16T | OCT: 1–4 octaves | GATE |
| | **ARP 2** | SWG swing | PROB probability of each note | HOLD: OFF / ON (latch) | ORD: NOTE / PLAY (live only), SNOTE / SPLAY (recorded steps + live) |

The new arp modes work with held notes and one-finger chords. **OUTIN** alternates the lowest and highest notes, moving inward (C–E–G–B becomes C–B–E–G). **SHUF** plays each expanded note position once in random order before reshuffling; the same note can occur at the end of one cycle and the start of the next. **ROOTALT** alternates the lowest pitch with each other note (C–E–C–G–C–B); its anchor is the lowest voiced note, including when the chord is inverted. These three modes use pitch order across the octave range. **ORD** always uses the order you pressed the keys; the separate ORD setting still controls ordering for UP, DN, and UPDN. Probability retains its existing behavior: a skipped hit does not advance the note position.

| Additional arp mode | With C–E–G–B held |
| --- | --- |
| **DNUP** | B–G–E–C–E–G, then repeat; no repeated endpoints |
| **UPDNREP** | C–E–G–B–B–G–E–C, then repeat; repeats both endpoints |
| **INOUT** | E–G–C–B, then repeat; odd-sized chords start on their middle note |
| **WALK** | Starts on C, then randomly moves one position up or down; reverses at the ends |
| **PULSE** | All held notes and selected octaves together on each hit |

These modes use pitch order across the octave range. PULSE sends each distinct pitch once per hit, so overlapping octaves do not double a note. RATE, GATE, SWG, PROB, and HOLD apply to the whole pulse. Changing modes, turning HOLD off with no keys held, STOP, panic, and section changes release every active pulse tone. Holding or latching notes after STOP lets the arp continue on its stopped clock. Internal sound still shares the eight-voice budget; MIDI can carry the full expanded chord. Recording uses the existing sequencer limit of four notes per synth step (one in mono modes); a larger pulse cannot be captured in full. PULSE starts its tones together and does not apply STRUM.
| **SEQ** | **STEP** | STEP (cursor) | NOTE | TIME: NOTE, TIE, REST | FLAG: –, ACC, SLD, A+S |
| | **PATTERN** | LEN 1–64 steps | DIV 1/4 … 2BAR | SWG track swing | GATE note length |
| | **SONG** | the SONG screen | | | |
| **GLO** | **GLOBAL** | BPM 40–240 | SWING (all tracks) | CLICK: OFF, REC, ON | TUNE ±50 cents |
| | **MASTER** | DUST | DUCK | FILT (DJ filter) | ROLL (note-repeat rate) |
| | **SYSTEM** | MIDI out: KEYS / SEQ | SYNC: INT, USB, TRS | IN: NOTES / CLOCK | CPU load (USB link state when no computer is connected) |
| | **DRUMS** | CH: the drum track's MIDI input channel (0 = off, default 10) | LVL drum level | REV drum reverb | DLY drum delay (2.5): the drums into the tempo delay (FX → DLY sets its time, feedback and tone), saved with the project |
| **SAVE** | **PRESETS** | the sound | the engine | — | — |
| | **USER** | SLOT 1–32 | LOAD (GO) | ERASE (GO) | SAVE (GO) |
| | **PROJECT** | SLOT 1–4 | — | LOAD (GO) | SAVE (GO) |
| | **TOOLS** | CLRSQ: clear the pattern (GO) | INIT: reset the sound (GO) | — | NEW project (GO) |

Notes:

- **Global** pages (DLY, REV/CHO, GLOBAL, MASTER, SYSTEM, DRUMS) are the same whatever track is selected.
- **SYNC**, **MIDI** and **IN** are settings of the FM-1, kept when you load a project.
- On the **drum track**, the pages that work are SLICER, PATTERN (SEQ), the SONG screen and the global pages; its kit, level, reverb and pan are on the DRUMS kit page, and its filter is **FX + KNOB 4**.
- FM6 tracks ignore the ENV page and ENV DEST (each operator has its own envelope).
- On the screen, EDIT 1 and EDIT 2 carry the engine's own page names: ANALOG *OSC / FLT*, DIGITAL *OPS / MOD*, PHASE *PHS / LINE*, LOFI *CHIP / MOTN*, SAMPLE *SET / TONE*, VOICE *VOWL / TONE*, TRIO *OSC / TONE*, WHEEL *BARS / TONE*, GRAIN *GRAN / SPRY*, FM6 *OPS / PATCH*, PHYS *BODY / EXCT*, NOISE *SRC / MOVE*.
- Any sound parameter on these pages can be **locked** on a step (see [Parameter locks](#parameter-locks)), except the pattern, arp, key and voice-mode ones.

## 17. The sounds and the twelve engines

### The sound bank

**153 factory sounds**, every one a full patch on one of the twelve engines, all level-matched (the same LEVEL gives the same loudness). **PRESETS** browses them **by kind** — basses, keys, organs, pads, leads, plucks and bells, stabs, FX — with the kind shown next to the name; your **32 user presets** come after. A new project starts at **90 BPM** with *808 BOOM* on track 1, *RHODES* on track 2, *LOFI FLUTE* on track 3 and the 808 kit on track 4.

To pick an engine directly: SAVE → PRESETS → **KNOB 2**. To start from the engine's defaults: SAVE → TOOLS → **INIT**.

### The twelve engines

Each engine's eight parameters are on **EDIT 1** (KNOB 1–4) and **EDIT 2** (KNOB 1–4), tap EDIT once and twice; the screen shows them under the engine's own page names (for example DIGITAL: *OPS*, *MOD*). A dash is an unused knob.

| Engine | Sound | EDIT 1: KNOB 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 | EDIT 2: KNOB 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ANALOG** | virtual analogue: two oscillators, filter | WAVE (SAW, SQR, TRI, SIN, PWM) · DTN detune · MIX · NOIS noise | CUT cutoff · RES resonance · DRV drive · KTR key tracking |
| **DIGITAL** | 4-operator FM | ALG algorithm 1–8 · R2 · R3 · R4 (operator ratios) | IDX FM amount · MDEC modulator decay · FB feedback · — |
| **PHASE** | phase distortion (CZ style) | WAVE · WAVE2 (a second wave, or –) · DCW (the distortion amount) · ENV (its envelope) | DTN detune · LINE: MIX / RING · SUB sub-oscillator · — |
| **LOFI** | 8-bit chip | CHIP: 4BIT, 4B/2, 8BIT, 1BIT, STEP · WAVE: PLS, TRI, SAW, NOIS, WRAM · DUTY (pulse width / wave table) · CRSH crush (DCY on STEP) | SWP pitch sweep · VIB vibrato · ARP: OFF, OCT, MAJ, MIN (chip arpeggio) · TONE |
| **SAMPLE** | sampler | SET: PIANO, BASS, VIBES, HORNS, STRGS, FLUTE, SCRCH, PERC, **USR1–USR4** · TUNE ±24 · BITS (bit reduction) · LOOP: OFF / ON | CUT (tone) · — · DRV drive · — |
| **VOICE** | formant voice (choirs, talkbox) | VOWL vowel · VOWL2 second vowel · TALK (time from one to the other) · SHIFT formant shift ±12 | BUZZ · BRTH breath · Q · RAND |
| **TRIO** | three oscillators | WAVE (16 combinations) · INT2 · INT3 (intervals of oscillators 2 and 3, ±24) · DTN | MODE: LP, BP, HP, NOT (filter type) · CUT · RES · PW pulse width |
| **WHEEL** | tonewheel organ | REG (16 drawbar registrations: FLUTE, MELLO, HOLLW, SMOOT, 3BAR, BLUES, GOSPL, ROCK…) · SUB · BODY · TOP (drawbar groups ±8) | PERC: OFF, 2ND, 3RD, 2SOFT, 3SOFT, 2SLOW, 3SLOW · CLICK · DRV · ROTR: OFF, SLOW, FAST (rotary speaker) |
| **GRAIN** | granular | SRC (any sample set, USR1–USR4 too) · POS position · SIZE grain size · DENS density | PTCH ±24 · SPRD spread · RAND randomness · TONE |
| **FM6** | six-operator FM, DX7 patches | ALG: PAT (the patch's) or 1–32 · FB feedback · MLVL modulator level (brightness) · MRAT modulator ratio | MEG modulator envelopes slower / faster · VMOD velocity → brightness · DTUN carrier spread · PTCH: F1–F8 factory, B1–B27 your bank |
| **PHYS** | physical models: strings, bars and bells, drum heads, sympathetic strings (DaisySP and Rings, as Felucca 1.0 ported them; 3 voices a track, SYMP 2) | MODEL: MODAL, STRNG, MEMB, SYMP · STRC structure (MEMB: HARM, SYMP: CHRD the sympathetic strings' chord) · BRIT brightness · DAMP | POS strike / pluck position (SYMP: SYMP, how much they ring) · ACC accent · BOW bowing (MEMB: BEND, SYMP: BUZZ) · EXC the exciter in the mix |
| **NOISE** | noise, from analogue to digital: colours, crackle, shift registers, metallic tones | MODE: ANLG, DUST, LFSR, META · COLR white → pink → brown · FREQ · RES | TRK key tracking · DENS impulses (LFSR, META: LEN, the register) · DRFT drift · CRSH crush (LFSR, META: CLK, the clock above the key) |

The **SAMPLE** sets are free recordings (CC0: Versilian Studios VSCO-2 CE and VCSL, Sonic Pi), coloured like a record through an old sampler. **GRAND PNO** is a Steinway recorded note by note; long notes fade as on the real one.

### FM6 and DX7 patches

**FM6** is msfa, the synthesis core of Dexed, as Felucca 1.0 ported it: six operators with their own four-stage envelopes, keyboard scaling, velocity, ratio or fixed frequency and detune; 32 algorithms, feedback, LFO, pitch envelope; six voices per track. The eight EDIT values above are **macros on top of the patch**; the track's FLT moves MLVL (so LFO → FLT still brightens it), SHP the feedback, PIT the pitch.

Edit full patches in the web editor's **FM6** panel (Sound page, on an FM6 track): every operator, **Send to track**, **Store in bank** (B1–B27), **Import SysEx** (a DX7 voice or a 32-voice bank: thousands of DX7 and Dexed patches play on the FM-1; or drop the .syx file on the panel) and **Export SysEx**. **Store cartridge in bank** (2.5) puts a whole 32-voice cartridge on the FM-1 at once: the first 27 voices are ticked (or tick the ones you want, up to 27), and one write puts them in B1, B2… in order; the editor asks before replacing, and the rest of the bank stays. Stop the song first. Before storing you can choose to **also add them to the user presets** (in the free slots, or from a slot you pick): each voice gets a user preset with its name that plays its B slot, so on the FM-1 you pick it by name with **PRESETS** or **SELECT**, like any sound; the editor says which user presets it would replace. (A user preset keeps PTCH, not the patch: the voice itself stays in the bank.) Then pick them on the FM-1 with **PTCH** (EDIT page 2: B1–B27 after the factory F1–F8). A project keeps the track's **PTCH**, not the patch itself: store an edited patch in the bank to keep it.

## 18. Effects: master, punch-in, per track

### Signal path

Each synth track: engine → **drive** (DST) → **SLICER** → **FILTER** (the track's own) → level (and DUCK) → pan and **sends** to the stereo chorus, the tempo delay and the reverb. The drum track has its own slicer, filter, level, pan, reverb send and (2.5) delay send. Then the whole mix, with the effect returns: **DUST** → **punch-in effects** → **FILT** (the DJ filter) → **MASTER** volume → limiter.

### Master: DUST, DUCK, FILT, ROLL

On FX + KNOB 1–3, or GLO → MASTER:

| | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **DUST** 0–100 % | the mix through an old sampler and a record: drive into a soft clip, a lower sample rate (down to ~11 kHz), fewer bits (down to 8), a low-pass closing to ~3 kHz, and, while the transport plays, a little hiss and crackle (a stopped SLOOP is silent) |
| **DUCK** 0–100 % | every kick pumps the synth tracks down and back over an 1/8 note: the sidechain sound, in time at any tempo |
| **FILT** | a DJ filter: left of centre a low-pass closing, right a high-pass opening, centre OFF; it glides (no zipper noise) |
| **ROLL** | the note-repeat rate of ARP + key |

### Punch-in effects

**FX + white key**: the effect runs on the whole mix while the key is held and lets go cleanly when you release it. Loops and the gate are locked to the tempo and start on the grid.

| Key | Effect | Key | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 · F3 | loop 1/4 | 9 · G4 | low-pass sweep |
| 2 · G3 | loop 1/8 | 10 · A4 | high-pass sweep |
| 3 · A3 | loop 1/16 | 11 · B4 | phone |
| 4 · B3 | loop 1/32 | 12 · C5 | bit crush |
| 5 · C4 | stutter (1/16 triplets) | 13 · D5 | alias (sample-rate drop) |
| 6 · D4 | reverse | 14 · E5 | gate 1/16 |
| 7 · E4 | tape stop | 15 · F5 | echo (dotted 1/8) |
| 8 · F4 | half speed | 16 · G5 | tape wobble |

### Black-key punch modifiers (2.5 Merthsoft.3)

While **FX** is held (or its layer is locked), select a white-key effect and use:

| Physical black key | Control | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F♯3 | Slower | Half playback/rate; slower gate, echo timing and filter/wobble movement |
| G♯3 | Faster | Double playback/rate; faster gate, echo timing and filter/wobble movement |
| A♯3 | Triplet | Two-thirds loop/gate/echo divisions and faster wobble movement |
| C♯4 or C♯5 | Gentle (`soft`) | Lower wet amount and gentler filter/crush/alias/gate/echo/wobble settings |
| D♯4 or D♯5 | Extreme (`hard`) | Deeper filter/crush/alias/gate/echo/wobble settings; full wet amount |
| F♯4 or F♯5 | Blend (`mix`) | Halve the wet amount; stacks with Gentle |
| G♯4 | Latch (`lat`) | Toggle the selected effect's latch; releases of its white key and FX keep it running |
| A♯4 | Retrigger (`rst`) | Fade to dry, recapture/restart the selected effect on its normal grid, then fade back |

Rate, Triplet, intensity and Blend act **while their black keys are held**. Slower + Faster
cancel; Gentle + Extreme cancel. Repeated Gentle/Extreme/Blend keys remain active until
all copies are released. Momentary controls clear when you leave FX; Latch remains until
G♯4 toggles it off or **STOP** clears it. To unlatch, hold FX and press G♯4 again: a still-held
white key keeps sounding until released. Selecting another white effect replaces the
latched effect. Latch/Reset need a selected effect; they do not play synth notes or record.
The FX tiles show the adjacent black-key mappings, and the header/LEDs show latch status.

### Per track

- **FILTER** (FX → FILTER, or **FX + KNOB 4** for the selected track): one knob, left a low-pass, right a high-pass, centre off. It stays when you change the sound, can be locked on a step, and is saved with the project.
- **Sends** (FX page): DST drive, CHO chorus, DLY delay, REV reverb. The delay and the reverb / chorus settings are global (DLY and REV/CHO pages). The delay's TIME includes dotted 1/8 and 1/16.
- **SLICER** (FX → SLICER): a tempo gate (GATE) or stutter (STUT), 16 patterns, 1/8 to 32T, with a depth.

## 19. The visualiser

On the TRACKS screen, **tap HOME**: the whole screen becomes a visualiser of what SLOOP plays.

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **SELECT** | the next / previous style (its name shows a second; the last one is kept with the settings) |
| **HOME**, or any page button | closes it |
| keys, PLAY, REC, layers | work as ever (a held layer shows its screen, then the visualiser comes back) |
| KNOB 1–4 | nothing (the tempo is GLO + SELECT meanwhile) |

| # | Style | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **OSCILLOSCOPE** | the mix's wave, standing still |
| 2 | **SPECTRUM** | 32 bands with falling caps |
| 3 | **SPECTROGRAM** | the spectrum scrolling down, black → blue → green → yellow → white |
| 4 | **LISSAJOUS** | the stereo image: the wider the cloud, the wider the sound |
| 5 | **VU METERS** | tracks 1–4 in their colours and the mix, with peak holds |
| 6 | **CIRCLE** | the wave round a ring that swells on every kick |
| 7 | **ORBIT** | four planets turning in 1, 2, 4 and 8 beats round a sun that pulses with the mix |
| 8 | **WIRES** | a string per track, set swinging by its notes |
| 9 | **POLYRHYTHM** | four rings show each track's pattern length, active steps and independent playhead |
| 10 | **NOTE TRAILS** | scrolling pitches for all three synths, including chords and releases, with drum lanes below |
| 11 | **GROOVE** | eight steps per track: grid lines, swing, micro timing, hit levels and ratchet repeats |
| 12 | **STEREO FIELD** | a stereo cloud, left/right balance marker and a width bar |
| 13 | **SONG JOURNEY** | song order or quick chain, current entry and remaining bars |
| 14 | **BEAT TERRAIN** | spectrum-driven wireframe hills, moving at the tempo |

The visualiser sees the mix **as if MASTER were all the way up**: with MASTER turned down, even to 0, it still moves at full size. It costs the sound nothing.

---

## 20. The HOME menu and the lights

**Hold HOME** (0.7 s) to open the menu; hold it again to close it. The menu is in four sections:

| Section | KNOB 1 | KNOB 2 | KNOB 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SCREEN** | **COLOR**: the screen palette (GREEN, AMBER, CYAN, RED, MONO…) | **ZOOM**: ON shows the value you touch large and white | — |
| **LIGHTS** | **LIGHTS**: OFF, LOW, MID, HIGH | **KEYS**: OFF, C KEYS, WHITE KEYS, ALL KEYS | **NOTES**: OFF / ON |
| **AUDIO** | **SPEAKER LOWCUT**: ON cuts the lows the small speaker cannot play (~110 Hz) | **USB AUDIO**: MASTER / FULL | **USB SERIAL**: OFF / ON (developers; takes effect at the next start) |
| **SYSTEM** | **HARDWARE CALIBRATION** (the knob selects it, OCT+ opens it) | **ABOUT**, the version (the knob selects it, OCT+ opens it) | — |

| Control in the menu | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **SELECT** | the previous / next section |
| **KNOB 1, 2, 3** | set the section's rows directly (each row shows its knob's colour) |
| **PRESETS** | moves the cursor |
| **OCT+** | steps the cursor's setting round, or opens it (CALIBRATION, ABOUT) |
| **OCT−** | closes (from ABOUT: back to the section) |
| **hold HOME** | leaves the menu |

All of these are **settings of the FM-1**, kept when you load a project or start a new one.

### Lights

- **LIGHTS** — every button glows at that level, so its label can be read in the dark (on a black FM-1 the labels are unreadable unlit). What is on — the page, PLAY, REC, an octave — stays at full light and still blinks.
- **KEYS** — the Cs, every white key, or every key glow at the LIGHTS level too (KEYS turns LIGHTS on at LOW if it was off).
- **NOTES** — ON: the notes sounding on the selected synth track light their keys, played live or by the sequencer (each for at least a tenth of a second, so short sequencer notes show too). The drum track always lights its hits. Works on every page and in every layer.
- **Always:** PLAY flashes on every beat; REC blinks when armed and is solid while recording; the button of the page shown is lit; in a layer, keys 1, 5, 9, 13 glow dimly and what is on is fully lit; OCT− / OCT+ light when the octave is off 0; a locked layer's button blinks.

### Hardware calibration

If a button or knob does the wrong thing, HOME menu → SYSTEM → **HARDWARE CALIBRATION** (or hold **OCT− + OCT+** while switching on): press each button and turn each knob to the right as the screen asks. 30 s without input cancels it and keeps the old setup.

---

## 21. MIDI

### Where MIDI comes in

- **The MIDI IN jack** (3.5 mm TRS on the FM-1): a keyboard or pad controller with a MIDI output, through a TRS-to-DIN MIDI adapter. If nothing plays, try the other type of adapter (type A / type B).
- **USB**: a computer or phone (a DAW, a MIDI routing app) or a USB MIDI host box. A USB keyboard plugged straight into the FM-1 cannot work: both are USB devices, and a USB link needs a host.

Both work at once.

### Channels

| MIDI channel | Plays |
| --- | --- |
| **1, 2, 3** | synth tracks 1, 2, 3 |
| **10** | the drum track (the nearest of its 16 sounds; GLO → DRUMS → **CH** changes it, 0 = no drum input; the drums still go out on 10) |
| **4–16** | the **selected** track: set your keyboard to channel 4 and it follows ALGORITHM |

### MIDI settings (GLO → SYSTEM)

| Knob | Setting | Choices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KNOB 1 | **MIDI** (out) | **KEYS**: only what you play on the keys goes out · **SEQ**: the sequencer, the arp and the rolls go out too |
| KNOB 2 | **SYNC** (clock in) | **INT**: SLOOP's own tempo · **USB** or **TRS**: follow that MIDI clock |
| KNOB 3 | **IN** | **NOTES**: notes, CCs and clock · **CLOCK**: only the clock and START / CONTINUE / STOP, every incoming note and CC ignored |
| KNOB 4 | **CPU** | the processor load (or the USB link state while no computer is connected) |

All three are settings of the FM-1, kept when you load a project.

- **MIDI out:** each track on its channel (1–3 synths, 10 drums). With **SEQ**, set a DAW track to record the FM-1's MIDI and you get the pattern as notes, or let SLOOP drive another synth. Every note is ended, STOP ends whatever was still on, and notes that came in are never sent back (no MIDI loop).
- **Clock in:** START plays from the top, CONTINUE carries on, STOP stops; the tempo follows the master pulse by pulse (24 a beat), so SLOOP cannot drift. When the clock stops for half a second, PLAY on the FM-1 plays at its own tempo again. A MIDI START during the REC count-in starts and records at once.
- **Clock only (IN = CLOCK):** for a DAW or sequencer that sends notes to other gear on the same cable. A note-off still gets through, so nothing held when you switch is left hanging.
- **Bluetooth MIDI** is not supported: SLOOP never switches the radio on.

### MIDI CCs (2.5)

The knobs of a MIDI controller set the sound (the standard CC map of Felucca 1.1.5). A CC acts on the track its channel plays, as the notes do (1–3 the synths, the drum channel the drum track, 4–16 the selected track), and sets its parameter as a knob would: 0–127 over the parameter's range, 64 the middle of PAN and FILTER. It changes the sound's value itself (as a knob, so saving keeps it); the screen and the web editor follow.

| CC | Sets |
| --- | --- |
| 5 | GLIDE |
| 7 | LEVEL (on the drum channel: GLO → DRUMS → LVL) |
| 10 | PAN |
| 71 | the engine's resonance (RES or Q: ANALOG, TRIO, VOICE, NOISE; the others ignore it) |
| 72 · 73 · 75 | release · attack · decay |
| 74 | the track's FILTER: 64 off, lower a low-pass, higher a high-pass (every engine, the drums too) |
| 91 · 93 · 94 | the reverb, chorus and delay sends (on the drum channel 91 and 94 are GLO → DRUMS → REV and DLY) |

Other CCs (mod wheel, sustain, pitch bend…) are ignored.

---

## 22. USB audio

On USB the FM-1 is also an audio input named **Felucca**: 44.1 or 48 kHz (the computer, phone or tablet picks; 48 kHz since 2.5, for the phones and apps that only take it), 16-bit stereo, class compliant, no driver. In your DAW, in Audacity or in a sampler app on your phone (with a USB-C cable or adapter) choose that input and record: you get the master output, exactly what the headphones play (after DUST, DUCK and FILT; the click and count-in too if they are on). MIDI, the editor and the installer keep working on the same cable.

**HOME menu → AUDIO → USB AUDIO:**

- **MASTER** (default): the recording follows the MASTER knob, as the headphones do. Keep MASTER well up while you record.
- **FULL**: a fixed level, as with MASTER all the way up (kept from clipping by the limiter); MASTER then only sets the headphones. Best for a computer input with no level control of its own.

The first time, the computer sees the FM-1 as a slightly different device (MIDI + audio) and sets it up again. On macOS 13–15, keep **USB SERIAL** OFF (the default) or the audio input may not show.

---

## 23. Your own samples and drum kits

The FM-1 has **four sample slots**, **USR1–USR4**, of about **7.4 s** each (22 kHz mono). A slot holds either:

- **an instrument**, played by a synth track: engine **SAMPLE**, **SET = USR1 … USR4** (or the GRAIN engine's SRC), or
- **a drum kit**, played by the drum track: **KIT = USR1 … USR4**, or **USR3+4**, one big kit of about **15 s** over two slots.

A good setup: USR1 and USR2 as instruments, a big kit on USR3+4. You fill the slots from the web editor.

### An instrument (editor → Samples)

1. **Choose a slot.** Four tiles show what each slot holds and how full it is; the page warns when sending would replace something (or half of your USR3+4 kit).
2. **Make the sound**, one of two ways:
   - **From files (one note per file):** drop up to 16 WAV files (any rate, mono or stereo). Each plays at its own note, the keys between play the nearest one, pitched. The note is read from the file name (`KEYS_C4.wav`, C4 = 60) or set in the list; a keyboard picture shows which keys play which file; ▶ plays a file; the meter shows the time used.
   - **Chop a recording** (CHOP): open or drop a recording (WAV, MP3, AIFF…) and cut it into up to 16 chops, one per key.
3. **Send it and play it:** name it, **Send to USRn**, then **Play this slot on track 1, 2 or 3**: that track switches to SAMPLE with SET = USRn.

**CHOP** in detail:

| Control | Does |
| --- | --- |
| **TAP** (or the space bar) while it plays | a cut at that moment (*snap to the hit* puts it on the attack) |
| **Find hits** (with a sensitivity), **Grid**, **Equal parts** | cuts made for you |
| the box on a chop, **Keep all**, **Keep none**, **K** | keep or leave out chops (left-out chops go neither to the slot nor to the WAVs) |
| the length slider, or the handle at the bottom of the wave | shorten a chop; **Up to the next marker** undoes it |
| **Fit to slot** | shortens the longest chops just enough to fit |
| **Download WAVs** | the kept chops as WAV files |
| keys 1–9, 0 | listen to a chop |
| double-click / drag / ← → / Del | add / move / nudge / remove a marker |
| mouse wheel | zoom |

A recording of any length works: keep the chops you want, the slot takes about 7.4 s of them.

### A drum kit (editor → Drum kit)

1. **Your sounds.** Drop a WAV on any of the **16 pads** (KICK, KICK 2, SNARE, CLAP, HAT, OPEN HAT, PEDAL, RIM, SNARE 2, LOW TOM, HI TOM, CRASH, RIDE, SHAKER, CONGA, COWBELL), or **Choose files** to add several at once: they are sorted onto the pads by name (*kick*, *bd*, *snare*, *hh*, *open*, *crash*…; a second kick goes to KICK 2). Click a pad's wave to hear it. Each pad has **Pitch** (±12 semitones), **Gain** and **Length** (a cut ends with a short fade).
2. **Where it goes.** **USR3+4** (the big kit, about 15 s; the editor shares the sounds out over the two slots by itself), or a single slot **USR1–USR4** (about 7.4 s). Each choice shows what it holds now and what a send would replace. The meter shows the time used; too long? shorten the long sounds or press **Fit the slot**.
3. **Send it.** Name it, **Send**, then **Use … on the drum track** selects track 4 and sets its KIT (or turn PRESETS on the drum track: USR3+4 is the last kit).

**Save as ZIP** keeps the kit's 16 WAVs to share; **Open ZIP** (or dropping a .zip) loads one back.

On the FM-1 your kit works like any other: steps, levels, ratchets, fill conditions, the DRUMS grid, the keys, MIDI channel 10 (a note plays its lane's sound), the filter, the slicer, mute. The closed hat cuts the open one. A lane without a sound is silent, and so is an empty slot.

### Your own synthesised kits (SYN1–SYN4)

SLOOP 2.5: the editor's **Drum synth** page changes every value of a synthesised kit, sound by sound, and the FM-1 plays the change at once. Never stored, SYN1–SYN4 are copies of 808, 909, TRAP and TECHNO.

1. **Pick a kit**, SYN1 to SYN4, and give it a name (8 letters: the DRUMS screen shows it). **Start from** + **Copy** makes it a copy of any of the 32 kits.
2. **Pick a sound** (KICK, SNARE, CLAP, HAT, OPEN HAT, LOW TOM, HI TOM, CRASH, RIDE, SHAKER, CONGA, RIM, COWBELL, CLAVE, KICK 2, SNARE 2): it plays (also **Play**; **Play on change** plays it after every change).
3. **Change it.** Each value is a tile you drag up or down, or a bar; **double-click** puts back the value of the kit it started from.

| Group | Values |
| --- | --- |
| **Tone** | **WAVE** (OFF, SINE, TRI, SQUARE, FM, BELL) · **PITCH** (a note, its Hz) and **FINE** · **BEND** (semitones the pitch falls from at the hit) and **B.TIME** (how fast) · **HOLD** (at full level) and **DECAY** · **LEVEL** · **2ND** (a second partial: its ratio, the drum head's second mode) and **2ND LVL** · **CLICK** (the attack: the beater, the stick) |
| **Noise** | **NOISE** (OFF, WHITE, METAL: the 808's six squares, CYM: metal and white, CHIP: an 8-bit noise) · **CLAP** (three bursts, then the tail) · **LEVEL**, **HOLD**, **DECAY** · **HPF** (a high-pass on the noise) · **CHIP** (the chip noise's clock) |
| **Filter** | **FILTER** (OFF, LP, BP, HP) · **ON** (the noise, or ALL: the tone too) · **CUTOFF**, **RES** · **ENV** (octaves the cutoff starts above it, falling with the pitch) |
| **Out** | **DRIVE** · **LEVEL** (dB) |

**CRUSH** (bits off) and **S&H** (a lower sample rate) act on the whole kit.

4. **Store on the FM-1** keeps the four kits in flash (stop the song first); until then *not stored yet* shows (switched off before, the FM-1 may come back with the last stored kits). **Use on the drum track** sets KIT to it. **Save file / Open file**: a kit as a file, to share or to keep. A [backup](#backup-and-restore) holds the four kits too.

## 24. The web editor

Open it from the [installer page](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/), the [editor link](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/webapp/editor/), or **`OPEN-EDITOR.bat`**, in **Chrome or Edge** with the FM-1 on USB, and press **Connect** (allow MIDI). It follows the device live: turn a knob on the FM-1, the editor moves. It looks like the FM-1: the black screen, the four track colours, the FM-1's own pixel font. The language button switches English / Japanese.

**Layout:** the side bar has the pages in three groups — **Track** (Sound, Sequencer, Tracks, Song), **Sounds** (Library, Samples, Drum kit, Drum synth), **Device** (Projects, Settings) — and the connection. On top: the page title, the messages, and on the Track pages the **four tracks** (number, sound, engine): click one to select it. With the side bar focused, the arrow keys move between pages.

**Values:** each value is a tile you **drag up or down like a knob** (Shift: fine), or a bar: click it, then the wheel or the arrow keys (Shift: steps of 10); **double-click** resets it.

| Page | What you do there |
| --- | --- |
| **Sound** | every parameter of the selected track, as on the device: a card per button (ENV, LFO, EDIT, VOICE, FX, SEL, ARP), its pages as rows of four coloured values. **Engine** and **Presets** pickers, **Init sound**, **Copy to library**, **Save to file / Load file** (a sound as a file). On an FM6 track, the **FM6** panel: the six operators, **Read from track**, **Send to track** (*Send while editing* to hear every change), **Store in bank** (B1–B27), **Import SysEx** (or drop a .syx), **Store cartridge in bank** (2.5: the ticked voices of a bank into B1… in one write, and as user presets if you choose), **Export SysEx**, **Export bank as SysEx** |
| **Sequencer** | the pattern settings (LEN, DIV, SWG, GATE) and the steps as the device's tiles; the **step list** takes typed note names (*C4 E4 G4*). On the drum track: a **grid** of the 16 sounds × the steps, with the **kit**: choose a **level** (GHOST, SOFT, NORM, HARD) and a **roll** (x1–x4), then click a cell — a hit; click again (same level and roll) — cleared; **Shift+click** — one level louder. Click a step for its **detail**: **Nudge**, **Parameter locks** (+ lock, pick the parameter, set or delete), **Fill** (normal, fill only, no fill). **Reload**, **Clear sequence**. **Length**: − / + or type 1–64. **Grid / Piano roll** and **Export MIDI / Import MIDI**: see below |
| **Tracks** | the four channel strips: level, pan, mute, select; SOLO and REC shown as on the device |
| **Song** | the song order of the [SONG screen](#14-song-mode-sections-chains-songs): a row per section (A–D), its **bars** (1–64) and how many **times** in a row; **▲ ▼** move a row, **✕** removes it, **Add**; **At the end**: stop or start again. **Read from the FM-1**, **Send to the FM-1** (16 entries in all; stop the song first). A section whose slot is empty is marked: save it on the FM-1 first (SAVE + key 5–8) |
| **Library** | your sound library, kept in the browser: **Save current sound**, search by name or tag, filter by engine, sort, **Audition**, **To device slot**, **Rename**, **Tags**, **Duplicate**, **Delete**, **Export** / **Import** / **Export library**; copy factory presets in. Next to it the **32 user presets on the device**: **Load**, **Store current sound**, **To library**, **Erase**, **Export bank**. Drag sounds between the library and the slots |
| **Samples** | your instruments in USR1–USR4, in three steps (see [above](#an-instrument-editor--samples)), with CHOP |
| **Drum kit** | your own drum kits, in three steps (see [above](#a-drum-kit-editor--drum-kit)) |
| **Drum synth** | your own synthesised kits SYN1–SYN4: every value of every sound (see [above](#your-own-synthesised-kits-syn1syn4)) |
| **Projects** | the four project slots (**Load**, **Save**) and **Backup** (see below) |
| **Settings** | GLOBAL (BPM, SWING, CLICK, TUNE), **MASTER** (DUST, DUCK, FILT, ROLL), DRUMS (CH, LVL, REV, DLY), and the system information (firmware, sync, slots) |

### Piano roll and MIDI files (Sequencer)

**Piano roll** (a synth track): the steps left to right, the notes bottom to top (**Octave up / down** scroll). Choose a **note length** (1/1 to 1/16 of a bar, in steps of the track's DIV), then:

- click an empty spot: a note of that length. On the first step of a chord: one more note of it (4 at most, one length for all, as on the device);
- click a note: it goes (the last note of a chord leaves rests);
- drag the right end of a note: shorter or longer (ties), up to the next chord.

Every change goes to the FM-1 at once, and the grid shows the same steps.

**Export MIDI** saves the selected track's pattern as a MIDI file (`sloop-track1.mid`…): the notes with their lengths, levels and accents, at the song's tempo; the drum track as GM drum notes on channel 10.

**Import MIDI** reads a MIDI file into the selected track, at its DIV. First a preview: the file's track to take, how many notes and steps, and what changes on the way: notes off the grid moved to the nearest step, more than 4 notes on a step (the loudest kept), a note cut short by the next one, notes past step 64. **Import** replaces the track's pattern (and, ticked, sets its length); **Cancel** leaves it as it was. On the drum track, the GM notes go to the lanes (36 kick, 38 snare, 42 hat…) and the velocity to the levels, ghost to hard.

The editor writes presets, the FM6 bank and backups to flash only while the song is stopped, as the FM-1 does (it asks you to stop first). Try it without hardware: add `?mock=1` to the editor's address. The protocol is documented in [web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md](web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md).

## 25. Backup, rescue, going back, troubleshooting

### Backup and restore

Editor → **Projects** → **Backup**:

- **Save a backup** writes everything on the FM-1 to one file (`SLOOP-backup-DATE.json`): the music you are working on, the projects 1–4 (the song sections A–D), the 32 user presets, the FM6 bank, the SYN drum kits, the samples **USR1–USR4** (your drum kits with them) and the settings (colours, calibration, song order, lights, SYNC, MIDI OUT).
- **Restore from a file** puts it all back: what is on the FM-1 is replaced. Stop the song (PLAY) first. A damaged file is refused before anything is written, and each object is written as a save writes it (a cut-off restore never leaves half an object).

A 2.4 backup restores into 2.4 (or later) only. **Save a backup before every update and before going back.**

### Rescue and special modes

| Situation | Do |
| --- | --- |
| SLOOP does not start | hold **OCT−** alone while switching on (*SLOOP USB RESCUE*), then install again from the browser |
| An install stopped half-way | the FM-1 waits in update mode: press **INSTALL** again |
| Buttons or knobs do the wrong thing | hold **OCT− + OCT+** while switching on, or HOME menu → SYSTEM → HARDWARE CALIBRATION |
| A developer needs UBOOT | hold **OCT− + OCT+** for 5 s while stopped (*UPDATE MODE IN 3…*; let go to cancel) |

### Going back to the official firmware

On the installer page, open **Return to the official firmware (V15)**: save a backup with the editor first, download FM-1 V15 from m-vave.com, select its `FM-1.fwsc` (only that exact file is accepted) and install it. M-VAVE's own updater (M-UPGRADE) works too; close every other app that uses MIDI first. To come back, install SLOOP again and restore your backup.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| The installer or editor does not find the FM-1 | Chrome or Edge, a data cable, no hub, allow MIDI; close every other app or tab that uses MIDI, then reload |
| The black keys are silent on a synth track | it plays chords or the scale: SEL → CHORD OFF and KEYS OFF (with a chord on, the black keys change the chord: CHORD+) |
| Recorded notes move | SLOOP quantises to the track's DIV: use 1/32, or nudge the step (SEQ + step + KNOB 4) |
| Notes fade out on a dense part | the processor is at its limit; SLOOP fades one voice at a time (never the bass or lead) rather than glitching. Fewer held notes or a lighter engine help |
| Nothing from the MIDI IN jack | try the other adapter type (A / B); check the channel (1–3, 10, 4–16) and that GLO → SYSTEM → IN is NOTES |
| The USB audio input does not show | replug the FM-1; on a Mac keep USB SERIAL OFF and restart the FM-1; in Audacity: Transport → Rescan Audio Devices |
| The USB recording is quiet | HOME menu → USB AUDIO = FULL, or MASTER up |
| An FM6 sound changed after loading a project | store the edited patch in the bank (editor → FM6 → Store in bank) and set PTCH to it |
| *STOP THE SONG FIRST* / *STOP FIRST* | that change (new project, song edit, flash write) waits until the transport is stopped |
| *EMPTY SECTION: REC* | the section you asked for has nothing in it: save a loop into it first (SAVE + key 5–8) |
| Something else | [open an issue](../../issues): what you did, what you expected, what happened, and the version (HOME menu → SYSTEM → ABOUT) |

### Recorded chords driving the arpeggiator

On a synth track, turn ARP on, then **ARP 2 → ORD → SNOTE** (pitch order) or
**SPLAY** (live press / stored note order). Recorded chord steps now feed the arp;
the sequencer does not also play the chord directly. TIE sustains its input, REST
clears it, and live keys still contribute. NOTE/PLAY restore the previous live-only
arp plus direct sequence behavior; ARP OFF plays the recorded steps directly.
STOP clears the sequence and live latch. The arp keeps its own rate/gate/probability.
Factory sound recall may reset ORD. This does not create follower tracks or infer roots.
